INTRODUCTION

If the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.

�ISAAC BABEL

War and Peace is the most famous and at the same time the most daunting of Russian novels, as vast as Russia itself and as long to cross from one end to the other. Yet if one makes the journey, the sights seen and the people met on the way mark one�s life forever. The book is set in the period of the Napoleonic wars (1805�1812) and tells of the interweaving of historical events with the private lives of two very different families of the Russian nobility�the severe Bolkonskys and the easygoing Rostovs�and of a singular man, reminiscent of the author himself�Count Pierre Bezukhov. It embodies the national myth of �Russia�s glorious period,� as Tolstoy himself called it, in the confrontation of the emperor Napoleon and Field Marshal Kutuzov, and at the same time it challenges that myth and all such myths through the vivid portrayal of the fates of countless ordinary people of the period, men and women, young and old, French as well as Russian, and through the author�s own passionate questioning of the truth of history.

Tolstoy wrote that he �spent five years of ceaseless and exclusive labor, under the best conditions of life,� working on War and Peace. Those were the years from 1863 to 1868. He was thirty-five when he began. The year before, he had married Sofya Behrs, the daughter of a Moscow doctor, who was eighteen, and they had moved permanently to his estate at Yasnaya Polyana, in Tula province, a hundred and twenty miles south of Moscow. She bore him four children while he worked on the book, was his first reader (or listener), and was in part the model for his heroine, Natasha Rostov.

The orderliness and routine of family life and estate management were not only the best conditions for work, they were also new conditions for Tolstoy. His mother had died when he was two. His father had moved to Moscow with the children in 1830, but died himself seven years later, and the children were eventually taken to Kazan by their aunt. Tolstoy entered Kazan University in 1844 but never graduated; his later attempts to pass examinations at Petersburg University also led to nothing. In 1851, after several years of idle and dissipated life in Moscow and Petersburg, he visited the Caucasus with his brother Nikolai, who was in the army, and there took part in a raid on a Chechen village, which he described a year later in a story entitled �The Raid,� his first attempt to capture the actuality of warfare in words. His experiences in the Caucasus were also reflected in his novel The Cossacks, which he began writing in 1853 but finished only nine years later, and in his very last piece of fiction, the superb short novel Hadji Murad, completed in 1904 but published only posthumously.

In 1852, he joined the army as a noncommissioned officer and served in Wallachia. Two years later he was promoted to ensign and was transferred at his own request to the Crimea, where he fought in the Crimean War and was present at the siege of Sevastopol. His Sevastopol Sketches, which were published in 1855, made him famous in Petersburg social and literary circles. They were a second and fuller attempt at a true depiction of war.

During his army years, Tolstoy lived like a typical young Russian officer, drinking, gambling, and womanizing. In 1854 he lost the family house in Yasnaya Polyana at cards, and it was dismantled and moved some twenty miles away, leaving only a foundation stone on which Tolstoy later had carved: HERE STOOD THE HOUSE IN WHICH L. N. TOLSTOY WAS BORN. In 1856 he was promoted to lieutenant but resigned his commission and returned to the estate, where he lived in one of the surviving wings of the house and began to occupy himself with management and the education of the peasant children. By then, besides the works I have already mentioned, he had also published the semi-fictional trilogy Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth.

The years from 1857 to 1862 were a time of restlessness and seeking for Tolstoy. He had left Petersburg, disgusted by the literary life there. He made two trips abroad. During the first, in 1857, he forced himself to witness a public execution in Paris, and the sight shook him so deeply that he vowed he would never again serve any government. At the beginning of the second trip, in September 1860, he visited his beloved brother Nikolai, who was dying of tuberculosis in the southern French town of Hy&#232;res. The death and burial of his brother were, he said, �the strongest impression in my life.� In 1861 he returned to Yasnaya Polyana, where he began work on a novel about the Decembrists, a group of young aristocrats and officers who, at the death of the emperor Alexander I in December 1825, rose up in the name of constitutional monarchy, were arrested and either executed or sent to Siberia. This novel would eventually become War and Peace.

Tolstoy himself later described the process of its transformation. At first he had wanted to write about a Decembrist on his return from Siberia in 1856, when the exiles were pardoned by Alexander II. In preparation for that, he went back to 1825, the year of the uprising itself, and from there to the childhood and youth of his hero and the others who took part in it. That brought him to the war of 1812, with which he became fascinated, and since those events were directly linked to events of 1805, it was there that he decided to begin. The original title, in the serial publication of the book, was The Year 1805; it was only in 1867 that he changed it to War and Peace, which he may have borrowed from a work by the French socialist thinker Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, whom he had met in Brussels during his second trip abroad. All that remains of the Decembrists in the final version are some slight hints about the futures of Pierre Bezukhov and of Prince Andrei Bolkonsky�s son Nikolenka.

The book grew organically as Tolstoy worked on it. In 1865, partly under the influence of Stendhal�s Charterhouse of Parma, he revised the battle scenes he had already written and added new ones, including one of the most important, the description of the battle of Sch&#246;ngraben. Coming across a collection of Masonic texts in the library of the Rumyantsev Museum, he became interested and decided to make Pierre Bezukhov a Mason. He studied the people of Moscow at the theaters, in the clubs, in the streets, looking for the types he needed. A great many of his fictional characters, if not all of them, had real-life models. The old Prince Bolkonsky and the old Count Rostov were drawn from Tolstoy�s grandfathers, Nikolai Rostov and Princess Marya from his parents, Sonya from one of his aunts. The Rostov estate, Otradnoe, is a reflection of Yasnaya Polyana. Tolstoy spent two days on the battlefield of Borodino and made his own map of the disposition of forces, correcting the maps of the historians. He collected a whole library of materials on the Napoleonic wars, many bits of which also found their way into the fabric of the book. His memory for historical minutiae was prodigious. But above all, there is the profusion and precision of sensual detail that brings the world of War and Peace so vividly to life. In his autobiographical sketch, People and Situations (1956), Pasternak wrote of Tolstoy:


All his life, at every moment, he possessed the faculty of seeing phenomena in the detached finality of each separate instant, in perfectly distinct outline, as we see only on rare occasions, in childhood, or on the crest of an all-renewing happiness, or in the triumph of a great spiritual victory.

To see things like that, our eye must be directed by passion. For it is passion that by its flash illuminates an object, intensifying its appearance.

Such passion, the passion of creative contemplation, Tolstoy constantly carried within him. It was precisely in its light that he saw everything in its pristine freshness, in a new way, as if for the first time. The authenticity of what he saw differs so much from what we are used to that it may appear strange to us. But Tolstoy was not seeking that strangeness, was not pursuing it as a goal, still less did he apply it to his works as a literary method.


I was struck, while working on the translation of War and Peace, by the impression that I was translating two books at the same time. Not two books in alternation, as one might expect from the title, but two books simultaneously. One is a very deliberate and self-conscious work, expressive of the outsize personality of its author, who is everywhere present, selecting and manipulating events, and making his own absolute pronouncements on them: �On the twelfth of June, the forces of Western Europe crossed the borders of Russia, and war began�that is, an event took place contrary to human reason and to the whole of human nature.� It is a work full of provocation and irony, and written in what might be called Tolstoy�s signature style, with broad and elaborately developed rhetorical devices�periodic structure, emphatic repetitions, epic similes. The other is an account of all that is most real and ordinary in life, all that is most fragile and therefore most precious, all that eludes formulation, that is not subject to absolute pronouncements, that is so mercurial that it can hardly be reflected upon, and can be grasped only by a rare quality of attention and self-effacement. And it is written in a style that reaches the expressive minimum of a sentence like K&#225;pli k&#225;pali, �Drops dripped��which makes silence itself audible. It seems to me that the incomparable experience of reading War and Peace comes from the shining of the one work through the other�an effect achieved by artistic means of an unusual sort.

The first thing a reader today must overcome is the notion of War and Peace as a classic, the greatest of novels, and the model of what a novel should be. In 1954, Bertolt Brecht wrote a note on �Classical Status as an Inhibiting Factor� that puts the question nicely. �What gets lost,� he says of the bestowing of classical status on a work (he is speaking of works for the theater), �is the classic�s original freshness, the element of surprise�of newness, of productive stimulus that is the hallmark of such works. The passionate quality of a great masterpiece is replaced by stage temperament, and where the classics are full of fighting spirit, here the lessons taught the audience are tame and cozy and fail to grip.�

The first readers of War and Peace were certainly surprised, but often also bewildered and even dismayed by the book. They found it hard to identify the main characters, to discover anything like a plot, to see any connection between episodes, to understand the sudden leaps from fiction to history, from narration to philosophizing. There seemed to be no focus, no artistic unity to the work, no real beginning, and no resolution. It was as if the sheer mass of detail overwhelmed any design Tolstoy might have tried to impose on it. Such observations were made by Russian critics, including Tolstoy�s great admirer, Ivan Turgenev, and when the book became known in translation, they were repeated by Flaubert and by Henry James, who famously described War and Peace as a �large loose baggy monster.�

Another cause of surprise for its first readers was the language of War and Peace. The book opens in French�not with a few words of French (as in those English versions that do not eliminate the French altogether), but with a whole paragraph of French, with only a few phrases of Russian at the end. This mixing of French and Russian goes on for another five chapters or more, and occurs frequently throughout the rest of the book. There are also some long letters entirely in French, as well as official dispatches, and quotations from the French historian Adolphe Thiers. There are passages in German as well. For all of them Tolstoy supplied his own translations in footnotes, as we do. But that made the question still more problematic, because Tolstoy�s translations are occasionally inaccurate, perhaps deliberately so. The amount of French in the text is smaller than some early critics asserted�not a third, but only about two percent. But there is also a great deal of gallicized Russian, either implying that the speaker is speaking in French, or showing that upper-class ladies like Julie Karagin are unable to write correctly in their own language. And there are other heterogeneous elements in the composition: Tolstoy�s map and commentary on the battlefield of Borodino, and his own interpolated essays, which repeatedly disrupt the fictional continuum.

The formal structure of War and Peace and the texture of its prose are indeed strange. Those who did not simply declare the book a failure, dismissing the newness, the �passionate quality� and �fighting spirit� of what Tolstoy was doing as artistic helplessness and na&#239;vet&#233;, often said that it succeeded in spite of its artistic flaws. But that is a false distinction. War and Peace is a work of art, and if it succeeds, it cannot be in spite of its formal deficiencies, but only because Tolstoy created a new form that was adequate to his vision.

It is equally mistaken to go to the other extreme and declare, as more recent critics have done, that, far from being a magnificent failure, War and Peace is a masterpiece of nineteenth-century realism, simple and artless, a direct transcription of life. Tolstoy was well aware of the perplexities his book caused and addressed them in an article (included here as an appendix) entitled �A Few Words Apropos of the Book War and Peace,� published in the magazine Russian Archive in 1868, before the final parts of the book had appeared in print. �What is War and Peace?� he asked.


It is not a novel, still less an epic poem, still less a historical chronicle. War and Peace is what the author wanted and was able to express, in the form in which it is expressed. Such a declaration of the author�s disregard of the conventional forms of artistic prose works might seem presumptuous, if it were premeditated and if it had no previous examples. The history of Russian literature since Pushkin�s time not only provides many examples of such departure from European forms, but does not offer even one example to the contrary. From Gogol�s Dead Souls to Dostoevsky�s Dead House, there is not a single work of artistic prose of the modern period of Russian literature, rising slightly above mediocrity, that would fit perfectly into the form of the novel, the epic, or the story.


Two things in this passage are especially characteristic of Tolstoy: first, the negative definition of the genre; and second, the assertion that his departure from artistic convention was not premeditated. Both might be taken as disingenuous, but I do not think they are. Tolstoy was trying to express something which, to his mind, had never been expressed before, and which therefore required a new form that could only define itself as he worked. By excluding the known forms of extended narrative, he leaves an empty place in which an as yet unknown form, indefinable and unnameable, may appear. (He uses the same negative method throughout War and Peace itself.) But this procedure was not premeditated�that is, as Pasternak rightly said, it was not a literary method, not a play with form for its own sake in the modernist sense. He found it necessary for the task he had set himself.

What was that task? What was it that Tolstoy �wanted to express� in his book, which he deliberately does not call a novel? Boris de Schloezer, a fine critic and philosopher, wrote in the preface to his French translation of War and Peace (1960) that Tolstoy�s one aim, from the beginning, was �to speak the truth� as perceived by his eye and his conscience. �All the forces of his imagination, his power of evocation and expression, converge on that one single goal. Outside any other religious or moral considerations, Tolstoy when he writes obeys one imperative, which is the foundation of what one might call his literary ethic. That imperative is not imposed on the artist by the moralist, it is the voice of the artist himself.� As early as the sketch �Sevastopol in May� of 1855, Tolstoy had asserted, �My hero is truth.� In War and Peace he wanted to speak the truth about a certain period of Russian life�the period of the Napoleonic wars of 1805 to 1812. He wanted to say, not how that period could be made to appear in a beautiful lie, an entertaining or instructive story, a historical narrative, but how it was. He wanted to capture in words what happened the way it happened. But how does happening happen? How can words express it without falsifying it? How can one capture the past once it is past? These were questions that Tolstoy constantly brooded on. He had already posed them for himself in 1851, in his very first literary work, the fragment �A History of Yesterday.� The composition of War and Peace was his fullest response to them.

Po&#232;te et non honn&#234;te homme, wrote Pascal, meaning that a poet cannot be an honest man. Tolstoy fully agreed with Pascal; he tried all his life to be honn&#234;te homme et non po&#232;te. Nabokov, in his lecture notes on Anna Karenina, speaks of �Tolstoy�s style with its readiness to admit any robust awkwardness if that is the shortest way to sense.� Yet Tolstoy found that the truth could not be approached directly, that every attempt at direct expression became a simplification and therefore a lie, and that the �shortest way to sense� was rather long and indirect. He was acutely aware of the inadequacy of all human means of speaking the truth, but his artistic intuition told him that those means might be composed in such a way as to allow the truth to appear. Against his will, he found that to be an honest man he had to be a poet.

In the fifth section of �A Few Words,� Tolstoy freely embraces that role, discussing the differences between the historian and the artist. �A historian and an artist, describing a historical epoch, have two completely different objects�For a historian, considering the contribution rendered by some person towards a certain goal, there are heroes; for the artist, considering the correspondence of this person to all sides of life, there cannot and should not be any heroes, but there should be people.� And further on: �A historian has to do with the results of an event, the artist with the fact of the event.� And again: �The difference between the results obtained is explained by the sources from which the two draw their information. For the historian (we continue the example of a battle), the main source is the reports of individual commanders and the commander in chief. The artist can draw nothing from such sources, they tell him nothing, explain nothing. Moreover, the artist turns away from them, finding in them a necessary falsehood.� Neither here nor elsewhere, however, does Tolstoy say what sources the artist does draw from. To compound the problem, he says at the end of the same section: �But the artist should not forget that the notion of historical figures and events formed among people is based not on fantasy, but on historical documents, insofar as historians have been able to amass them; and therefore, while understanding and presenting these figures and events differently, the artist ought to be guided, like the historian, by historical materials.� The difference lies not in the figures and events that are seen, but in the way of seeing them: the artist sees not heroes but people, not results but facts, and considers a person not in terms of a goal, but �in correspondence to all sides of life��with what Pasternak calls �the passion of creative contemplation,� which Tolstoy wisely avoids defining.

This leads to a crucial if paradoxical reversal: the most real and even, in Tolstoy�s sense, historical figures in War and Peace turn out to be the fictional ones; and the most unreal, the most insubstantial and futile, the historical ones. Tolstoy undermines the idea of significant action, though it was the foundation of virtually all narrative before him. He does not say that all action is insignificant, but that the only significant actions are the insignificant ones, whose meaning lies elsewhere, not in the public space but in absolute solitude. For Prince Andrei there is something in the infinite sky above him, but it is not a general idea, and he is unable to communicate it to anyone else. In her comparison of Homer and Tolstoy (On the Iliad, translated by Mary McCarthy, New York, 1947), Rachel Bespaloff wrote: �Great common truths are disclosed to man only when he is alone: they are the revelation made by solitude in the thick of collective action.� Tolstoy grants this intimate but immense reality to each of his major characters, and to many of the minor ones (who then cease to be minor). Yet there is nothing very remarkable about these characters. Turgenev complained that they were all mediocrities, and in a sense he was right. They are ordinary men and women. Tolstoy was aware of that; it was what he intended. As Rachel Bespaloff observed: �Tolstoy�s universe, like Homer�s, is what our own is from moment to moment. We don�t step into it; we are there.�





A few words about translation and this translation.

It is often said that a good translation is one that �does not feel like a translation,� one that reads �smoothly� in �idiomatic� English. But who determines the standard of the idiomatic, and why should it be applied to something so idiolectic as a great work of literature? Is Melville idiomatic? Is Faulkner? Is Beckett? Those who raise the question of the �idiomatic� in translation do not seem to realize that they are imposing their own, often very narrow, limits on the original. A translator who turns a great original into a patchwork of readymade �contemporary� phrases, with no regard for its particular tone, rhythm, or character, and claims that that is �how Tolstoy would have written today in English,� betrays both English and Tolstoy. Translation is not the transfer of a detachable �meaning� from one language to another, for the simple reason that in literature there is no meaning detachable from the words that express it. Translation is a dialogue between two languages. It occurs in a space between two languages, and most often between two historical moments. Much of the real value of translation as an art comes from that unique situation. It is not exclusively the language of arrival or the time of the translator and reader that should be privileged. We all know, in the case of War and Peace, that we are reading a nineteenth-century Russian novel. That fact allows the twenty-first century translator a different range of possibilities than may exist for a twenty-first century writer. It allows for the enrichment of the translator�s own language, rather than the imposition of his language on the original.

To move from that fertile ground towards either extreme�that is, towards interlinear literalness or total accommodation to the new language�is to lose the possibilities that exist only in the space between two times and languages. Tolstoy�s prose has been much praised and much criticized. He scorned fine writers, calling them �hairdressers,� yet we know from the many drafts he preserved that he constantly worked over his texts, revising and refining them, bringing them closer to what he wanted to express. Tolstoy�s prose is an artistic medium; it is all of a piece; it is not good or bad Russian prose, it is Tolstoyan prose. What the translator should seek in his own language is the equivalent of that specific artistic medium. He must have the freedom in his own language to be faithful to the original.

In Tolstoy: A Critical Introduction (Cambridge, 1969), R. H. Christian says: �From the point of view of language and style, Tolstoy has been better served by his translators than many of his fellow-countrymen. Nevertheless, standards fall a long way short of perfection. Clumsiness and simplesse apart, no English version of War and Peace has succeeded in conveying the power, balance, rhythm and above all the repetitiveness of the original. Perhaps it is repetition which is the most characteristic single feature of Tolstoy�s prose style.� He illustrates his point with two passages, the second of which, in our translation, reads as follows (italics added):


�thought Prince Andrei, waiting among many significant and insigificant persons in Count Arakcheev�s anteroom.

During his service, mostly as an adjutant, Prince Andrei had seen many anterooms of significant persons, and the differing characters of these anterooms were very clear to him. Count Arakcheev�s anteroom had a completely special character. The insignificant persons waiting in line for an audience in Count Arakcheev�s anteroom�


Without mentioning the parallel play on �significant and insignificant persons,� Christian notes that the Russian word pri&#233;mnaya (�anteroom�) recurs five times in as many lines, and that the Maude translation (1927) glosses over that fact by omitting the word once and using three different words for the rest. I will add that in Ann Dunnigan�s translation (1968) the repetitions are treated in exactly the same way as in the Maudes� that Anthony Briggs, in his 2005 version, omits the repeated word twice and varies it twice; while Constance Garnett (1904) omits it once, but otherwise keeps the repetitions. This passage is a fairly restrained example of what I have called Tolstoy�s �signature style,� but it does illustrate how the balance and rhythm of his prose depend on repetition. These qualities are lost when the general principle of avoiding repetitions is mechanically applied to it. Tolstoy also had a fondness for larger rhetorical structures based on repeated triads of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on. We have made it a point to keep his repetitions, as well as other devices of formal rhetoric (for instance, chiasmus) that Tolstoy consciously used and that his translators have often ignored. Tolstoy once boasted that in writing War and Peace he had used every rhetorical device of the old Latin grammarians, which means they are not there by chance.

The other extreme of Tolstoy�s style is exemplified by the short sentence (the shortest in War and Peace) that I have already quoted: �Drops dripped.� It is the first sentence of a paragraph made up of four brief, staccato sentences, four quite ordinary observations, which acquire a lyrical intensity owing solely to the sound and rhythm of the words: K&#225;pli k&#225;pali. Shy&#243;l t&#237;khii g&#243;vor. L&#243;shadi zarzh&#225;li i podr&#225;lis. Khrap&#233;l kt&#243;-to. �Drops dripped. Quiet talk went on. Horses neighed and scuffled. Someone snored.� It is a night scene, and one of the most haunting moments in the book. Other English versions translate the first sentence as �The branches dripped,� �The trees were dripping,� or, closer to the Russian, �Raindrops dripped.� They all state a fact instead of rendering a sound, which (by a stroke of translator�s luck) comes out almost the same in English as in Russian.

Here is another example of the same stylistic compactness, this time expressing a psychological insight rather than a sense impression. It describes the moment when Natasha, who has almost cut herself off from all life, suddenly has to take care of her grief-stricken mother. Tolstoy says simply: Prosn&#250;las lyub&#243;v, i prosn&#250;las zh&#237;zn. �Love awoke, and life awoke.� All that Tolstoy leaves unsaid about Natasha�s inner life in these few words is implied by their very matter-of-factness, expressed in the exact rhetorical balance of the phrasing. Other English versions read: �Love was awakened, and life waked with it,� �Love awoke, and so did life,� or �When love reawakened, life reawakened.� They convey the same general meaning, but hardly the same sense as the original.

A final example. Tolstoy describes children playing in their room when their mother comes in: Dy&#233;ti na st&#250;lyakh y&#233;khali v Moskv&#250; i priglas&#237;li yey&#243; s sob&#243;yu. �The children were riding to Moscow on chairs and invited her to go with them.� To translate the first phrase as �The children were sitting on chairs playing at driving to Moscow,� or �The children were playing at �going to Moscow� in a carriage made of chairs,� or �The children were perched on chairs playing at driving to Moscow,� as has been done, is to miss both the rhythm and the point. The charm of Tolstoy�s sentence comes from the fact that he does not explain in an adult way what the children are doing; he enters into the spirit of their game by the phrasing he uses to describe it, and the whole atmosphere of the moment is suddenly there, na&#239;ve, natural, and alive.

I do not mean to suggest that Tolstoy calculated these effects. They are not �effects� at all, they are what he saw and felt, as he wanted and was able to express it. But to translate what he saw and felt, one must also translate, as far as possible, the way it is expressed. These examples will give at least an idea of how we have gone about that task. We have kept all the French and German as Tolstoy had it, as well as the mixed voicings, the Gallicisms, Germanisms and implied foreign accents, as they play throughout the book. We have tried to be true to Tolstoy�s rhetorical power, his sharp irony, and his astonishing delicacy.

PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS

Russian names are composed of first name, patronymic (from the father�s first name), and family name. Formal address requires the use of first name and patronymic; diminutives are commonly used among family and friends and are for the most part endearing, though in a certain blunt form (Katka for Katerina, Mitka for Dmitri) they can be rude or dismissive; the family name alone can also be used familiarly or casually, and on occasion only the patronymic is used, usually among the lower classes. In speech, the patronymic can also take a shortened form: Andreich instead of Andreevich, or Kirilych instead of Kirillovich. The accented syllables of Russian names are long, the others very short. We also give the French forms of first names as Tolstoy uses them.

I

�Eh bien, mon prince, G&#234;nes et Lucques ne sont plus que des apanages, des estates, de la famille Buonaparte.Non, je vous pr&#233;viens, que si vous ne me dites pas que nous avons la guerre, si vous vous permettez encore de pallier toutes les infamies, toutes les atrocit&#233;s de cet Antichrist (ma parole, j�y crois)�je ne vous connais plus, vous n�&#234;tes plus mon ami, vous n�&#234;tes plus my faithful slave, comme vous dites. Well, good evening, good evening. Je vois que je vous fais peur, sit down and tell me about it.�

So spoke, in July 1805, the renowned Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and intimate of the empress Maria Feodorovna, greeting the important and high-ranking Prince Vassily, the first to arrive at her soir&#233;e. Anna Pavlovna had been coughing for several days. She had the grippe, as she put it (grippe was a new word then, used only by rare people). Little notes had been sent out that morning with a red-liveried footman, and on all of them without distinction there was written:

Si vous n�avez rien de mieux &#224; faire, Monsieur le comte (or mon prince), et si la perspective de passer la soir&#233;e chez une pauvre malade ne vous effraye pas trop, je serai charm&#233;e de vous voir chez moi entre 7 et 10 heures.

Annette Scherer.

�Dieu, quelle virulente sortie!� the entering prince replied, not ruffled in the least by such a reception. He was wearing an embroidered court uniform, stockings, shoes, and stars, and had a bright expression on his flat face.

He spoke that refined French in which our grandparents not only spoke but thought, and with those quiet, patronizing intonations which are proper to a significant man who has grown old in society and at court. He went over to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting her with his perfumed and shining bald pate, and settled comfortably on the sofa.

�Avant tout dites-moi, comment vous allez, ch&#232;re amie. Set me at ease,� he said, without changing his voice and in a tone in which, through propriety and sympathy, one could discern indifference and even mockery.

�How can one be well�when one suffers morally? Is it possible to remain at ease in our time, if one has any feeling?� said Anna Pavlovna. �You�ll stay the whole evening, I hope?�

�And the f&#234;te at the British ambassador�s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance,� said the prince. �My daughter will come to fetch me and take me there.�

�I thought today�s f&#234;te was cancelled. Je vous avoue que toutes ces f&#234;tes et tous ces feux d�artifice commencent &#224; devenir insipides.�

�If they had known that you wished it, the f&#234;te would have been cancelled,� said the prince, uttering out of habit, like a wound-up clock, things that he did not even wish people to believe.

�Ne me tourmentez pas. Eh bien, qu�a-t-on d&#233;cid&#233; par rapport &#224; la d&#233;p&#234;che de Novosilzoff?Vous savez tout.�

�What can I tell you?� said the prince, in a cold, bored tone. �Qu�a-t-on d&#233;cid&#233;? On a d&#233;cid&#233; que Buonaparte a br&#251;l&#233; ses vaisseaux, et je crois que nous sommes en train de br&#251;ler les n&#244;tres.�

Prince Vassily always spoke lazily, the way an actor speaks a role in an old play. Anna Pavlovna Scherer, on the contrary, despite her forty years, was brimming with animation and impulses.

Being an enthusiast had become her social position, and she sometimes became enthusiastic even when she had no wish to, so as not to deceive the expectations of people who knew her. The restrained smile that constantly played on Anna Pavlovna�s face, though it did not suit her outworn features, expressed, as it does in spoiled children, a constant awareness of her dear shortcoming, which she did not wish, could not, and found no need to correct.

In the midst of a conversation about political doings, Anna Pavlovna waxed vehement.

�Ah, don�t speak to me of Austria! Maybe I don�t understand anything, but Austria does not want and has never wanted war. She�s betraying us. Russia alone must be the savior of Europe. Our benefactor knows his lofty calling and will be faithful to it. That is the one thing I trust in. Our kind and wonderful sovereign is faced with the greatest role in the world, and he is so virtuous and good that God will not abandon him, and he will fulfill his calling to crush the hydra of revolution, which has now become still more terrible in the person of this murderer and villain. We alone must redeem the blood of the righteous one. In whom can we trust, I ask you?�England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand all the loftiness of the emperor Alexander�s soul. She refused to evacuate Malta. She wants to see, she searches for ulterior motives in our acts. What did they say to Novosiltsov? Nothing. They did not, they could not understand the self-denial of our emperor, who wants nothing for himself and everything for the good of the world. And what have they promised? Nothing. And what they did promise will not be done! Prussia has already declared that Bonaparte is invincible and that all Europe can do nothing against him�And I don�t believe a single word of Hardenberg or of Haugwitz.Cette fameuse neutralit&#233; prussienne, ce n�est qu�un pi&#232;ge. I trust only in God and in the lofty destiny of our dear emperor. He will save Europe!�� She suddenly stopped with a mocking smile at her own vehemence.

�I think,� the prince said, smiling, �that if they sent you instead of our dear Wintzingerode, you would take the Prussian king�s consent by storm. You�re so eloquent! Will you give me tea?�

�At once. &#192; propos,� she added, calming down again, �I�ll have two very interesting men here tonight, le vicomte de Mortemart, il est alli&#233; aux Montmorency par les Rohan, one of the best French families. He�s one of the good &#233;migr&#233;s, one of the real ones. And then l�abb&#233; Morio �do you know that profound mind? He�s been received by the sovereign. Do you know him?�

�Ah! I�ll be very glad,� said the prince. �Tell me,� he added, as if just recalling something and with special casualness, though what he asked about was the main purpose of his visit, �is it true that l�imp&#233;ratrice-m&#232;re wants Baron Funke to be named first secretary in Vienna? C�est un pauvre sire, ce baron, &#224; ce qu�il para&#238;t.� Prince Vassily wanted his son to be appointed to this post, which, through the empress Maria Feodorovna, had been solicited for the baron.

Anna Pavlovna all but closed her eyes as a sign that neither she nor anyone else could judge of the empress�s good pleasure or liking.

�Monsieur le baron de Funke a &#233;t&#233; recommand&#233; &#224; l�imp&#233;ratrice-m&#232;re par sa soeur,� she merely said in a sad, dry tone. The moment Anna Pavlovna mentioned the empress, her face suddenly presented a profound and sincere expression of devotion and respect, combined with sadness, which happened each time she referred to her exalted patroness in conversation. She said that her majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke beaucoup d�estime, and her eyes again clouded over with sadness.

The prince lapsed into indifferent silence. Anna Pavlovna, with her courtly and feminine adroitness and ready tact, wanted both to swat the prince for daring to make such a pronouncement about a person recommended to the empress, and at the same time to comfort him.

�Mais &#224; propos de votre famille,� she said, �do you know that your daughter, since her coming out, fait les d&#233;lices de tout le monde? On la trouve belle, comme le jour.�

The prince bowed in a sign of respect and gratitude.

�I often think,� Anna Pavlovna went on after a moment�s silence, moving closer to the prince and smiling tenderly at him, as if to show thereby that the political and social conversations were at an end and a heart-to-heart one was beginning, �I often think how unfairly life�s good fortune is sometimes distributed. Why has fate given you two such nice children (excluding Anatole, your youngest, I don�t like him),� she put in peremptorily, raising her eyebrows, �such lovely children? And you really value them less than anyone and are therefore unworthy of them.�

And she smiled her rapturous smile.

�Que voulez-vous? Lavater aurait dit que je n�ai pas la bosse de la paternit&#233;,� said the prince.

�Stop joking. I wanted to talk seriously with you. You know, I�m displeased with your younger son. Just between us,� her face acquired a sad look, �there was talk about him at her majesty�s, and you were pitied��

The prince did not reply, but she fell silent, looking at him significantly, waiting for a reply. Prince Vassily winced.

�What am I to do?� he said finally. �You know, I did all a father could for their upbringing, and they both turned out des imb&#233;ciles. Ippolit is at least an untroublesome fool, but Anatole is a troublesome one. That�s the only difference,� he said, smiling more unnaturally and animatedly than usual, and with that showing especially clearly in the wrinkles that formed around his mouth something unexpectedly coarse and disagreeable.

�Ah, why do such people as you have children? If you weren�t a father, I�d have nothing to reproach you for,� said Anna Pavlovna, raising her eyes pensively.

�Je suis votre faithful slave, et &#224; vous seule je puis l�avouer. My children�ce sont les entraves de mon existence. That�s my cross. I explain it that way to myself. Que voulez-vous?�� He paused, expressing with a gesture his submission to cruel fate.

Anna Pavlovna fell to thinking.

�Have you never thought of getting your prodigal son Anatole married? They say,� she observed, �that old maids ont la manie des marriages. I don�t feel I have that weakness yet, but I know one petite personne who is very unhappy with her father, une parente &#224; nous, une princesse Bolkonsky.� Prince Vassily did not reply, though, with the quickness of grasp and memory characteristic of society people, he showed by a nod of the head that he had taken this information into account.

�No, you know, this Anatole costs me forty thousand a year,� he said, obviously unable to restrain the melancholy course of his thoughts. He paused.

�How will it be in five years, if it goes on like this? Voil&#224; l�avantage d�&#234;tre p&#232;re. Is she rich, this princess of yours?�

�Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. You know, it�s the famous Prince Bolkonsky, already retired under the late emperor and nicknamed �the King of Prussia.� He�s a very intelligent man, but an odd and difficult one. La pauvre petite est malheureuse comme les pierres. She has a brother, Kutuzov�s adjutant, the one who recently married Lise Meinen. He�ll come tonight.�

�&#201;coutez, ch&#232;re Annette,� said the prince, suddenly taking his interlocutor by the hand and pulling it down for some reason. �Arrangez-moi cette affaire et je suis votre faithful slave &#224; tout jamais (slafe�comme mon village headman &#233;crit des reports: f instead of v). She�s from a good family and rich. That�s all I need.�

And with those free and familiarly graceful movements which distinguished him, he took the maid of honor�s hand, kissed it, and, having kissed it, waved the maid-of-honorly hand a little, sprawled himself in an armchair, and looked away.

�Attendez,� Anna Pavlovna said, pondering. �Tonight I�ll discuss it with Lise (la femme du jeune Bolkonsky). And maybe something can be settled. Ce sera dans votre famille que je ferai mon apprentissage de vielle fille.�


II

Anna Pavlovna�s drawing room gradually began to fill up. The high nobility of Petersburg came, people quite diverse in age and character, but alike in the society they lived in. Prince Vassily�s daughter, the beautiful H&#233;l&#232;ne, came to fetch her father and go with him to the f&#234;te at the ambassador�s. She was wearing a ball gown with a monogram. The young little princess Bolkonsky, known as la femme la plus s&#233;duisante de P&#233;tersbourg, also came; married the previous winter, she did not go into high society now for reason of her pregnancy, but did still go to small soir&#233;es. Prince Ippolit, Prince Vassily�s son, came with Mortemart, whom he introduced; the abb&#233; Morio also came, and many others.

�Have you seen yet� or �have you made the acquaintance of ma tante?� Anna Pavlovna said to the arriving guests, and led them quite seriously to a little old lady in high ribbons, who had come sailing out of the next room as soon as the guests began to arrive, called them by name, slowly shifting her gaze from the guest to ma tante, and then walked away.

All the guests performed the ritual of greeting the totally unknown, totally uninteresting and unnecessary aunt. With sad, solemn sympathy, Anna Pavlovna followed their greetings, silently approving of them. To each of them ma tante spoke in the same expressions about his health, her own health, and the health of her majesty, which, thank God, was better that day. All those who went up to her, showing no haste for propriety�s sake, left the little old lady with a feeling of relief after the fulfillment of a heavy obligation, never to approach her again all evening.

The young princess Bolkonsky came with handwork in a gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty upper lip with its barely visible black mustache was too short for her teeth, but the more sweetly did it open and still more sweetly did it sometimes stretch and close on the lower one. As happens with perfectly attractive women, her flaw�a short lip and half-opened mouth�seemed her special, personal beauty. Everyone felt cheerful looking at this pretty future mother full of health and liveliness, who bore her condition so easily. To old men and to bored, morose young ones it seemed that they themselves came to resemble her, having been with her and spoken with her for a time. Anyone who talked with her and saw her bright little smile at every word and her gleaming white teeth, which showed constantly, thought himself especially amiable that day. And that is what each of them thought.

The little princess, waddling, went around the table with small, quick steps, her bag of handwork hanging on her arm, and, cheerfully straightening her dress, sat down on the sofa near the silver samovar, looking as though everything she did was a partie de plaisir for her and for everyone around her.

�J�ai apport&#233; mon ouvrage,� she said, unclasping her reticule and addressing them all together.

�Look, Annette, ne me jouez pas un mauvais tour,� she turned to the hostess. �Vouz m�avez &#233;crit que c�&#233;tait une toute petite soir&#233;e; voyez comme je suis attif&#233;e.�

And she spread her arms to show her elegant gray, lace-trimmed dress, tied slightly below the breasts with a broad ribbon.

�Soyez tranquille, Lise, vous serez toujours la plus jolie,� Anna Pavlovna replied.

�Vous savez, mon mari m�abandonne,� she went on in the same tone, turning to a general, �il va se faire tuer. Dites moi, pourquoi cette vilaine guerre?� she said to Prince Vassily and, not waiting for an answer, turned to Prince Vassily�s daughter, the beautiful H&#233;l&#232;ne.

�Quelle d&#233;licieuse personne, que cette petite princesse!� Prince Vassily said to Anna Pavlovna.

Soon after the little princess came a massive, fat young man with a cropped head, in spectacles, light-colored trousers of the latest fashion, a high jabot, and a brown tailcoat. This fat young man was the illegitimate son of a famous courtier from Catherine�s time, Count Bezukhov, who was now dying in Moscow. He did not serve anywhere yet, he had only just arrived from abroad, where he had been educated, and this was his first time in society. Anna Pavlovna greeted him with a nod reserved for people of the lowest hierarchy in her salon. But, despite this greeting of the lowest sort, at the sight of the entering Pierre uneasiness and fear showed in Anna Pavlovna�s face, like that expressed at the sight of something all too enormous and unsuited to the place. Though Pierre was indeed somewhat larger than the other men in the room, this fear could have referred only to the intelligent and at the same time shy, observant, and natural gaze which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.

�C�est bien aimable &#224; vous, monsieur Pierre, d�&#234;tre venu voir une pauvre malade,� Anna Pavlovna said to him, exchanging fearful looks with the aunt, to whom she was bringing him. Pierre burbled something incomprehensible and went on searching for something with his eyes. He smiled joyfully, merrily, bowed to the little princess as to a close acquaintance, and went up to the aunt. Anna Pavlovna�s fear was not in vain, because Pierre, without hearing out the aunt�s talk about her majesty�s health, walked away from her. The frightened Anna Pavlovna stopped him with the words:

�You don�t know the abb&#233; Morio? He�s a very interesting man�� she said.

�Yes, I�ve heard about his plan for eternal peace, and it�s very interesting, but hardly possible��

�You think so?�� said Anna Pavlovna, in order to say something, and again turned to her duties as mistress of the house, but Pierre committed the reverse discourtesy. Earlier he had walked away without hearing out a lady who was talking to him; now he held with his conversation a lady who needed to leave him. Lowering his head and spreading his big feet, he began to explain to Anna Pavlovna why he thought that the abb&#233;�s plan was a chimera.

�We�ll talk later,� Anna Pavlovna said, smiling.

And, ridding herself of the young man who did not know how to live, she returned to her duties as mistress of the house and went on listening and looking out, ready to come to the rescue at any point where the conversation lagged. As the owner of a spinning mill, having put his workers in their places, strolls about the establishment, watching out for an idle spindle or the odd one squealing much too loudly, and hastens to go and slow it down or start it up at the proper speed�so Anna Pavlovna strolled about her drawing room, going up to a circle that had fallen silent or was too talkative, and with one word or rearrangement set the conversation machine running evenly and properly again. But amidst all these cares there could still be seen in her a special fear for Pierre. She glanced at him concernedly when he went over to listen to what was being talked about around Mortemart and went on to another circle where the abb&#233; was talking. For Pierre, brought up abroad, this soir&#233;e of Anna Pavlovna�s was the first he had seen in Russia. He knew that all the intelligentsia of Petersburg was gathered there, and, like a child in a toy shop, he looked everywhere at once. He kept fearing to miss intelligent conversations that he might have listened to. Looking at the self-assured and elegant expressions on the faces gathered here, he kept expecting something especially intelligent. Finally he went up to Morio. The conversation seemed interesting to him, and he stopped, waiting for a chance to voice his thoughts, as young people like to do.


III

Anna Pavlovna�s soir&#233;e got going. The spindles on all sides hummed evenly and ceaselessly. Besides ma tante, next to whom sat only one elderly lady with a thin, weepy face, somewhat alien to this brilliant company, the company had broken up into three circles. In one, mostly masculine, the center was the abb&#233; in another, of young people, it was the beautiful Princess H&#233;l&#232;ne, Prince Vassily�s daughter, and the pretty, red-cheeked little princess Bolkonsky, too plump for her age. In the third, it was Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna.

The viscount was a nice-looking young man, with soft features and manners, obviously regarded himself as a celebrity, but, from good breeding, modestly allowed himself to be made use of by the company in which he found himself. Anna Pavlovna was obviously treating her guests to him. As a good ma&#238;tre d�h&#244;tel presents, as something supernaturally excellent, a piece of beef one would not want to eat if one saw it in the dirty kitchen, so that evening Anna Pavlovna served up to her guests first the viscount, then the abb&#233;, as something supernaturally refined. In Mortemart�s circle the conversation turned at once to the murder of the duc d�Enghien. The viscount said that the duc d�Enghien had perished from his own magnanimity and that there were special reasons for Bonaparte�s viciousness.

�Ah, voyons. Contez-nous cela, vicomte,� said Anna Pavlovna, joyfully sensing that something &#224; la Louis XV echoed in this phrase, �contez-nous cela, vicomte.�

The viscount bowed as a sign of submission and smiled politely. Anna Pavlovna circled around the viscount and invited everyone to listen to his story.

�Le vicomte a &#233;t&#233; personellement connu de monseigneur,� Anna Pavlovna whispered to one. �Le vicomte est un parfait conteur,� she said to another. �Comme on voit l�homme de la bonne compagnie,� she said to a third; and the viscount was presented to the company in a most refined and advantageous light, like a roast beef on a hot platter sprinkled with herbs.

The viscount was just about to begin his story and smiled subtly.

�Come over here, ch&#232;re H&#233;l&#232;ne,� Anna Pavlovna said to the beautiful princess, who was sitting some way off, forming the center of another circle.

Princess H&#233;l&#232;ne was smiling; she got up with the same unchanging smile of a perfectly beautiful woman with which she had entered the drawing room. Lightly rustling her white ball gown trimmed with ivy and moss, her white shoulders gleaming, her hair and diamonds shining, she walked straight on between the parted men, not looking at anyone, but smiling to everyone, and as if kindly granting each of them the right to admire the beauty of her figure, her full shoulders, her very exposed bosom and back, as the fashion then was, and, as if bringing with her the brilliance of a ball, approached Anna Pavlovna. H&#233;l&#232;ne was so good-looking that there was not only not a trace of coquetry to be seen in her, but, on the contrary, it was as if she was embarrassed by her unquestionable and all too strongly and triumphantly effective beauty. It was as if she wished but was unable to diminish the effect of her beauty.

�Quelle belle personne!� said everyone who saw her. As if struck by something extraordinary, the viscount shrugged his shoulders and lowered his eyes while she was seating herself before him and shining upon him that same unchanging smile.

�Madame, je crains pour mes moyens devant un pareil auditoire,� he said, inclining his head with a smile.

The princess rested the elbow of her bare, rounded arm on a little table and did not find it necessary to say anything. She waited, smiling. Throughout the story she sat erect, glancing occasionally now at her rounded, beautiful arm lying lightly on the table, now at the still more beautiful bosom on which she straightened a diamond necklace; she also straightened the folds of her gown several times, and, when the story produced an impression, turned to look at Anna Pavlovna and at once assumed the same expression as on the maid of honor�s face, and then settled back into a radiant smile. After H&#233;l&#232;ne, the little princess also came over from the tea table.

�Attendez-moi, je vais prendre mon ouvrage,� she said. �Voyons, &#224; quoi pensez-vous?� she turned to Prince Ippolit. �Apportez-moi mon reticule.�

The princess, smiling and talking with everyone, suddenly effected the transposition, and, taking a seat, cheerily settled herself.

�Now I feel good,� she said several times, and, asking them to begin, started to work.

Prince Ippolit fetched her reticule, came after her, and, moving his chair towards her, sat down close by.

Le charmant Hippolyte was striking in his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister, and still more in being strikingly unattractive, despite that resemblance. The features of his face were the same as his sister�s, but in her everything was lit up by her joyous, self-contented, young, unchanging smile and the extraordinary classical beauty of her body. In her brother, on the contrary, the same face was clouded by idiocy and invariably expressed a self-assured peevishness, and his body was skinny and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed to shrink into an indefinite and dull grimace, and his arms and legs always assumed an unnatural position.

�Ce n�est pas une histoire des revenants?� he said, sitting down near the princess and hastily affixing a lorgnette to his eyes, as if he was unable to start talking without this instrument.

�Mais non, mon cher,� the surprised storyteller said, shrugging his shoulders.

�C�est que je d&#233;teste les histoires des revenants,� said Prince Ippolit in such a tone that it was clear he had said these words and only then understood what they meant.

Because of the self-assurance with which he spoke, no one could make out whether what he had said was very clever or very stupid. He was wearing a dark green tailcoat, trousers the color of cuisse de nymphe effray&#233;e, as he said himself, stockings and shoes.

The vicomte told very nicely the then current anecdote that the duc d�Enghien had secretly gone to Paris to meet with Mlle George, and that there he had met Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress�s favors, and that there, having met the duke, Napoleon happened to fall into one of those faints he was prone to and found himself in the duke�s power, which the duke did not take advantage of, and that Bonaparte afterwards revenged himself for this magnanimity with the duke�s death.

The story was very nice and interesting, especially the moment when the rivals suddenly recognized each other, and the ladies, it seemed, were stirred.

�Charmant,� said Anna Pavlovna, looking questioningly at the little princess.

�Charmant,� whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if to signify that the interest and charm of the story kept her from going on working.

The viscount appreciated this silent praise and, smiling gratefully, began to go on; but at that moment Anna Pavlovna, who kept glancing at the young man she found so frightening, noticed that his conversation with the abb&#233; was much too loud and vehement, and she rushed to the rescue at the place of danger. Indeed, Pierre had managed to strike up a conversation with the abb&#233; about political balance, and the abb&#233;, obviously intrigued by the young man�s simplehearted vehemence, was developing his favorite idea before him. The two men listened and talked too animatedly and naturally, and it was this that Anna Pavlovna did not like.

�The means are European balance and the droit des gens,� the abb&#233; was saying. �Let a powerful state like Russia, famous for its barbarism, stand disinterestedly at the head of a union having as its purpose the balance of Europe�and it will save the world!�

�How are you going to find such balance?� Pierre began; but just then Anna Pavlovna came over and, with a stern glance at Pierre, asked the Italian how he was taking the local climate. The Italian�s face suddenly changed and acquired an insultingly false sweetness of expression, which was probably habitual with him in conversations with women.

�I�m so enchanted with the charms of the intelligence and cultivation of society, especially the women�s, where I have had the happiness to be received, that I have not yet had time to think about the climate,� he said.

Not letting go of the abb&#233; and Pierre, Anna Pavlovna, the better to keep an eye on them, joined them to the general circle.

Just then a new person entered the drawing room. This new person was the young Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, the little princess�s husband. Prince Bolkonsky was of medium height, a rather handsome young man with well-defined and dry features. Everything in his figure, from his weary, bored gaze to his quiet, measured gait, presented the sharpest contrast with his small, lively wife. Obviously, he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but was also so sick of them that it was very boring for him to look at them and listen to them. Of all the faces he found so boring, the face of his pretty wife seemed to be the one he was most sick of. With a grimace that spoiled his handsome face, he turned away from her. He kissed Anna Pavlovna�s hand and, narrowing his eyes, looked around at the whole company.

�Vous vous enr&#244;lez pour la guerre, mon prince?� said Anna Pavlovna.

�Le g&#233;n&#233;ral Koutouzoff,� said Bolkonsky, emphasizing the last syllable, zoff, like a Frenchman, �a bien voulu de moi pour aide-de-camp��

�Et Lise, votre femme?�

�She�ll go to the country.�

�Shame on you to deprive us of your lovely wife.�

�Andr&#233;,� said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish tone in which she addressed others, �what a story the viscount told us about mademoiselle George and Bonaparte!�

Prince Andrei closed his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who had not taken his joyful, friendly eyes off Prince Andrei since he entered the drawing room, went up to him and took his arm. Prince Andrei, without turning around, wrinkled his face into a grimace, expressing vexation at whoever had taken his arm, but, seeing Pierre�s smiling face, suddenly smiled an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.

�Well, well!�So you, too, are in high society!� he said to Pierre.

�I knew you�d be here,� Pierre replied. �I�ll come to you for supper,� he added softly, so as not to interfere with the viscount, who was going on with his story. �May I?�

�No, you may not,� Prince Andrei said, laughing, letting Pierre know by the pressure of his hand that there was no need to ask. He was about to say more, but just then Prince Vassily and his daughter rose, and the men stood up to let them pass.

�You will excuse me, my dear viscount,� Prince Vassily said to the Frenchman, gently pulling him down on his chair by the sleeve, so that he would not stand up. �This unfortunate f&#234;te at the ambassador�s deprives me of my pleasure and interrupts you. I�m very sorry to leave your delightful soir&#233;e,� he said to Anna Pavlovna.

His daughter, Princess H&#233;l&#232;ne, lightly holding the folds of her gown, walked between the chairs, and the smile shone still more brightly on her beautiful face. Pierre looked with enraptured, almost frightened eyes at this beauty as she walked past him.

�Very good-looking,� said Prince Andrei.

�Very,� said Pierre.

Passing by, Prince Vassily seized Pierre by the hand and turned to Anna Pavlovna.

�Educate this bear for me,� he said. �He�s been living with me for a month, and this is the first time I�ve seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the company of intelligent women.�


IV

Anna Pavlovna smiled and promised to occupy herself with Pierre, who she knew was related to Prince Vassily through his father. The elderly lady who had so far been sitting with ma tante hastily got up and overtook Prince Vassily in the front hall. All the former sham interest disappeared from her face. Her kind, weepy face expressed only anxiety and fear.

�What can you tell me, Prince, about my Boris?� she said, overtaking him in the front hall. (She pronounced the name Boris with a special emphasis on the o.) �I cannot remain in Petersburg any longer. Tell me, what news can I bring my poor boy?�

Though Prince Vassily listened to the elderly lady reluctantly and almost impolitely, and even showed impatience, she smiled at him gently and touchingly, and even took him by the arm to keep him from walking away.

�It won�t cost you anything to say a word to the sovereign, and he�ll be transferred straight away to the guards,� she pleaded.

�Believe me, Princess, I�ll do all I can,� replied Prince Vassily, �but it�s hard for me to ask the sovereign. I�d advise you to turn to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn�that would be smarter.�

The elderly lady bore the name of Princess Drubetskoy, one of the best families of Russia, but she was poor, had long since left society, and had lost her former connections. She had come now to solicit an appointment to the guards for her only son. She had invited herself and come to Anna Pavlovna�s soir&#233;e only in order to see Prince Vassily, only for that had she listened to the viscount�s story. Prince Vassily�s words frightened her; her once beautiful face showed spite, but that lasted no more than a moment. She smiled again and took a slightly stronger grip on Prince Vassily�s arm.

�Listen, Prince,� she said, �I�ve never asked you for anything, and never will, I�ve never reminded you of my father�s friendship for you. But now, I adjure you in God�s name, do this for my son, and I will consider you my benefactor,� she added hastily. �No, don�t be angry, but promise me. I asked Golitsyn and he refused. Soyez le bon enfant que vous avez &#233;t&#233;,� she said, trying to smile, though there were tears in her eyes.

�Pap&#225;, we�ll be late,� said Princess H&#233;l&#232;ne, who was waiting at the door, turning her beautiful head on her classical shoulders.

But influence in society is a capital that must be used sparingly, lest it disappear. Prince Vassily knew that and, having once realized that if he were to solicit for everyone who solicited from him, it would soon become impossible for him to solicit for himself, he rarely used his influence. In Princess Drubetskoy�s case, however, after her new appeal, he felt something like a pang of conscience. She had reminded him of the truth: he owed his first steps in the service to her father. Besides, he could see from the way she behaved that she was one of those women, especially mothers, who, once they take something into their heads, will not leave off until their desire is fulfilled, and are otherwise prepared to pester you every day and every minute, and even to make scenes. This last consideration gave him pause.

�Ch&#232;re Anna Mikhailovna,� he said, with his usual tone of familiarity and boredom, �it is almost impossible for me to do what you want; but to prove to you how much I love you and honor the memory of your late father, I will do the impossible: your son will be transferred to the guards, here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?�

�My dear, you are our benefactor! I expected nothing else from you; I knew how kind you are.�

He was about to leave.

�Wait, two more words. Une fois pass&#233; aux gardes�� She faltered. �You�re on good terms with Mikhail Ilarionovich Kutuzov, recommend Boris as his adjutant. Then I�ll be at peace and��

Prince Vassily smiled.

�That I will not promise you. You know how besieged Kutuzov has been since he was appointed commander in chief. He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies are conspiring to send their children to be his adjutants.�

�No, you must promise, I won�t let you go, my dear benefactor.�

�Pap&#225;,� the beauty repeated in the same tone, �we�ll be late.�

�Well, au revoir, good-bye, you see��

�So you�ll speak to the sovereign tomorrow?�

�Without fail, but to Kutuzov I don�t promise.�

�No, do promise, do promise, Basile,� Anna Mikhailovna said behind him, with the smile of a young coquette, which must have suited her very well once, but now did not go with her emaciated face.

She evidently forgot her age and employed, out of habit, all her old feminine resources. But as soon as he left, her face again acquired the same cold, sham expression it had had before. She went back to the circle, where the viscount was going on with his story, and again pretended to listen, waiting for the moment to leave, since her business was done.

�But how do you find all this latest comedy du sacre de Milan,� asked Anna Pavlovna. �Et la nouvelle com&#233;die des peuples de G&#234;nes et de Lucques, qui viennent pr&#233;senter leurs voeux &#224; M. Buonaparte. M. Buonaparte assis sur un tr&#244;ne, et exau&#231;ant les voeux des nations! Adorable! Non, mais c�est &#224; en devenir folle! On dirait, que le monde entier a perdu la t&#234;te.�

Prince Andrei grinned, looking straight into Anna Pavlovna�s face.

��Dieu me la donne, gare &#224; qui la touche,�� he said (Bonaparte�s words, spoken as the crown was placed on him). �On dit qu�il a &#233;t&#233; tr&#232;s beau en pronon&#231;ant ces paroles,� he added, and repeated the words once more in Italian: ��Dio mi la dona, guai a chi la tocca.��

�J�esp&#232;re enfin,� Anna Pavlovna continued, �que &#231;a a &#233;t&#233; la goutte d�eau qui fera d&#233;border le verre. Les souverains ne peuvent plus supporter cet homme, qui menace tout.�

�Les souverains? Je ne parle pas de la Russie,� the viscount said courteously and hopelessly. �Les souverains, madame? Qu�ont-ils fait pour Louis XVI, pour la reine, pour madame Elisabeth?Rien,� he continued, growing animated. �Et croyez-moi, ils subissent la punition pour leur trahison de la cause des Bourbons. Les souverains? Ils envoient des ambassadeurs complimenter l�usurpateur.�

And with a contemptuous sigh, he again changed position. At these words, Prince Ippolit, who had long been gazing at the viscount through his lorgnette, suddenly turned his whole body to the little princess and, asking her for a needle, began showing her the coat of arms of the Cond&#233;s, drawing with the needle on the table. He explained this coat of arms to her with a significant air, as if the princess had asked him about it.

�Baton de gueules, engr&#234;l&#233; de gueules d�azur�maison Cond&#233;,� he said.

The princess listened, smiling.

�If Bonaparte remains on the throne of France for another year,� the viscount continued the new conversation, with the air of a man who does not listen to others, but, in matters known better to him than to anyone else, follows only the train of his own thoughts, �things will go too far. Intrigues, coercion, banishments, executions will forever destroy French society�I mean good society�and then��

He shrugged his shoulders and spread his arms. Pierre was about to say something: the conversation interested him, but Anna Pavlovna, who was keeping watch on him, interrupted.

�The emperor Alexander,� she said, with the sadness that always accompanied her talk about the imperial family, �declared that he would leave it to the French themselves to choose their form of government. And I think there�s no doubt that the whole nation, freed of the usurper, will throw itself into the arms of the lawful king,� Anna Pavlovna said, trying to be amiable to the &#233;migr&#233; and royalist.

�That�s doubtful,� said Prince Andrei. �Monsieur le vicomte quite rightly supposes that things have already gone too far. I think it would be hard to return to the old ways.�

�From what I�ve heard,� Pierre, blushing, again mixed into the conversation, �almost all the nobility have already gone over to Bonaparte�s side.�

�It�s the Bonapartists who say that,� said the viscount, not looking at Pierre. �Right now it�s hard to know public opinion in France.�

�Bonaparte l�a dit,� Prince Andrei said with a grin. (It was evident that he did not like the viscount and that, though he was not looking at him, his talk was directed against him.)

��Je leur ai montr&#233; le chemin de la gloire,�� he said after a short silence, again repeating the words of Napoleon, ��ils n�en ont pas voulu; je leur ai ouvert mes antichambres, ils se sont pr&#233;cipit&#233;s en foule�� Je ne sais pas &#224; quel point il a eu le droit de le dire.�

�Aucun,� the viscount retorted. �After the duke�s murder, even the most partial people ceased to see a hero in him. Si m&#234;me &#231;a a &#233;t&#233; un h&#233;ros pour certains gens,� the viscount said, turning to Anna Pavlovna, �depuis l�assassinat du duc il y a un martyr de plus dans le ciel, un h&#233;ros de moins sur la terre.�

Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile appreciatively at these words of the viscount�s, Pierre again burst into the conversation, and Anna Pavlovna, though she anticipated that he would say something improper, could no longer stop him.

�The execution of the duc d�Enghien,� said Pierre, �was a necessity of state; and I precisely see greatness of soul in the fact that Napoleon was not afraid to take upon himself alone the responsibility for this act.�

�Dieu! mon dieu!� Anna Pavlovna whispered in a frightened whisper.

�Comment, monsieur Pierre, vous trouvez que l�assassinat est grandeur d�&#226;me?� said the little princess, smiling and drawing her work towards her.

�Ah! Oh!� said various voices.

�Capital!� Prince Ippolit said in English and began slapping his knee with his palm. The viscount merely shrugged.

Pierre gazed triumphantly at his listeners over his spectacles.

�I say that,� he went on desperately, �because the Bourbons fled from the revolution, abandoning the people to anarchy; and Napoleon alone was able to understand the revolution, to defeat it, and therefore, for the sake of the common good, he could not stop short at the life of a single man.�

�Wouldn�t you like to move to that table?� asked Anna Pavlovna. But Pierre, not answering, went on with his speech.

�No,� he said, growing more and more inspired, �Napoleon is great, because he stood above the revolution, put an end to its abuses, and kept all that was good�the equality of citizens and freedom of speech and of the press�and that is the only reason why he gained power.�

�Yes, if he had taken that power and, without using it for murder, given it to the lawful king,� said the viscount, �then I would call him a great man.�

�He couldn�t do that. The people gave him power only so that he could deliver them from the Bourbons, and because the people saw a great man in him. The revolution was a great thing,� M�sieur Pierre went on, showing by this desperate and provocative parenthetical phrase his great youth and desire to speak everything out all the sooner.

�Revolution and regicide a great thing?�After that�wouldn�t you like to move to that table?� Anna Pavlovna repeated.

�Contrat social,� the viscount said with a meek smile.

�I�m not talking about regicide. I�m talking about ideas.�

�Yes, the ideas of pillage, murder, and regicide,� an ironic voice interrupted again.

�Those were extremes, to be sure, but the whole meaning wasn�t in them, the meaning was in the rights of man, emancipation from prejudice, the equality of citizens; and Napoleon kept all these ideas in all their force.�

�Liberty and equality,� the viscount said scornfully, as if finally deciding to prove seriously to this young man all the stupidity of his talk, �these are resounding words that have long been compromised. Who doesn�t love liberty and equality? Our Savior already preached liberty and equality. Did people become happier after the revolution? On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Bonaparte destroyed it.�

Prince Andrei kept glancing with a smile now at Pierre, now at the viscount, now at the hostess. For the first moment of Pierre�s outburst, Anna Pavlovna was horrified, accustomed though she was to society; but when she saw that despite the blasphemous speeches uttered by Pierre, the viscount did not lose his temper, and when she became certain that it was now impossible to suppress these speeches, she gathered her forces and, joining the viscount, attacked the orator.

�Mais, mon cher monsieur Pierre,� said Anna Pavlovna, �how do you explain a great man who could execute a duke, or, finally, any simple man, without a trial and without guilt?�

�I�d like to ask,� said the viscount, �how monsieur explains the eighteenth Brumaire. Was that not a deception? C�est un escamotage, qui ne ressemble nullement &#224; la mani&#232;re d�agir d�un grand homme.�

�And the prisoners he killed in Africa?� said the little princess. �It�s terrible!� And she shrugged her shoulders.

�C�est un roturier, vous aurez beau dire,� said Prince Ippolit.

M�sieur Pierre did not know whom to answer, looked around at them all, and smiled. His smile was not like that of other people, blending into a non-smile. With him, on the contrary, when a smile came, his serious and even somewhat sullen face vanished suddenly, instantly, and another appeared�childish, kind, even slightly stupid, and as if apologetic.

To the viscount, who was meeting him for the first time, it was clear that this Jacobin was not at all as frightening as his words. Everyone fell silent.

�Do you want him to answer everybody at once?� asked Prince Andrei. �Besides, in the acts of a statesman one must distinguish among the acts of the private person, the military leader, and the emperor. So it seems to me.�

�Yes, yes, of course,� Pierre picked up, gladdened by the arrival of unexpected help.

�It�s impossible not to admit,� Prince Andrei went on, �that Napoleon was a great man on the bridge of Arcole, and in the Jaffa hospital, when he shook hands with the plague victims, but�there are other acts which are hard to justify.�

Prince Andrei, who evidently wanted to soften the awkwardness of Pierre�s speech, got up, intending to leave and making a sign to his wife.

Suddenly Prince Ippolit rose and, gesturing for everyone to stay and sit down, began to speak:

�Ah! aujourd�hui on m�a racont&#233; une anecdote moscovite, charmante: il faut que je vous en r&#233;gale. Vous m�excusez, vicomte, il faut que je raconte en russe. Autrement on ne sentira pas le sel de l�histoire.�

And Prince Ippolit began to speak in Russian, with a pronunciation such as Frenchmen have after spending a year in Russia. Everyone stayed: so animatedly, so insistently did Prince Ippolit call for attention to his story.

�In Moscou there is a ladee, une dame. And she is very stingee. She must �ave two valets de pied behind the carriage. And of very grand height. That was in her taste. Now, she �ad une femme de chambre, also of grand height. She said��

Here Prince Ippolit fell to thinking, evidently having a hard time working it out.

�She said�yes, she said: �Girl� (to the femme de chambre), �put on a livr&#233;e and come with me, behind the carriage, faire des visites.��

Here Prince Ippolit snorted and guffawed, far in advance of his listeners, which produced an impression unfavorable to the narrator. Many smiled, however, the elderly lady and Anna Pavlovna among them.

�So she went. Suddenly there was a strong wind. The girl lost her hat, and her long hairs came undone��

Here he could no longer control himself and began laughing fitfully, saying through his laughter:

�And the whole world found out��

With that the anecdote ended. Though it was not clear why he had told it, and why it absolutely had to be told in Russian, all the same Anna Pavlovna and the others appreciated Prince Ippolit�s social grace, in thus pleasantly putting an end to M�sieur Pierre�s unpleasant and ungracious outburst. After the anecdote, the conversation broke up into small, insignificant commentaries on past and future balls, on performances, and on who would see whom when and where.


V

Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charmante soir&#233;e, the guests began to leave.

Pierre was clumsy. Fat, unusually tall, broad, with enormous red hands, he did not, as they say, know how to enter a salon, and still less did he know how to leave one, that is, by saying something especially pleasant at the door. Besides that, he was absentminded. Getting up, he took a three-cornered hat with a general�s plumage instead of his own and held on to it, plucking at the feathers, until the general asked him to give it back. But all his absentmindedness and inability to enter a salon and speak in it were redeemed by his expression of good nature, simplicity, and modesty. Anna Pavlovna turned to him and, with a Christian meekness expressing forgiveness for his outburst, nodded to him and said:

�I hope to see you again, but I also hope that you will change your opinions, my dear M�sieur Pierre,� she said.

When she said this to him, he made no reply, but only bowed and once more showed everyone his smile, which said nothing except perhaps this: �Opinions are opinions, but you see what a good and nice fellow I am.� And everyone, including Anna Pavlovna, involuntarily felt it.

Prince Andrei went out to the front hall and, offering his shoulders to the footman, who was putting his cloak on him, listened indifferently to his wife�s chatter with Prince Ippolit, who also came out to the front hall. Prince Ippolit stood beside the pretty, pregnant princess and looked at her directly and intently through his lorgnette.

�Go in, Annette, you�ll catch cold,� said the little princess, taking leave of Anna Pavlovna. �C�est arr&#234;t&#233;,� she added softly.

Anna Pavlovna had already managed to speak with Liza about the match she was contriving between Anatole and the little princess�s sister-in-law.

�I�m relying on you, my dear friend,� Anna Pavlovna said, also softly, �you�ll write to her and tell me comment le p&#232;re envisagera la chose. Au revoir.� And she left the front hall.

Prince Ippolit went over to the little princess and, bringing his face down close to hers, began saying something to her in a half whisper. Two footmen, one the princess�s, the other his, waiting for them to finish talking, stood with shawl and redingote and listened to their French talk, which they could not understand, with such faces as if they understood what was being said but did not want to show it. The princess, as usual, talked smilingly and listened laughingly.

�I�m very glad I didn�t go to the ambassador�s,� said Prince Ippolit, �it�s boring�A wonderful evening. Wonderful, isn�t it so?�

�They say the ball will be very nice,� replied the princess, her slightly mustached lip pulling upwards. �All the beautiful society women will be there.�

�Not all, since you won�t be there; not all,� said Prince Ippolit, laughing joyfully, and, snatching the shawl from the footman, even shoving him, he began putting it on the princess. Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one would have been able to tell), he was a long while lowering his arms, even when the shawl was already put on, and it was as if he was embracing the young woman.

Graciously, but still smiling, she withdrew, turned, and looked at her husband. Prince Andrei�s eyes were shut, which made him look tired and sleepy.

�Are you ready, madame?� he asked his wife, looking past her.

Prince Ippolit hastily put on his redingote, which, in the new style, hung lower than his heels, and, tangling himself in it, ran to the porch after the princess, whom the footman was helping into the carriage.

�Princesse, au revoir,� he cried, his tongue getting as tangled as his feet.

The princess, picking up her dress, was settling herself in the darkness of the carriage; her husband was straightening his sword; Prince Ippolit, on the pretext of being of service, got in everyone�s way.

�Ex-cuse me, sir,� Prince Andrei, with dry unpleasantness, addressed himself in Russian to Prince Ippolit, who was standing in his way.

�I�ll be waiting for you, Pierre,� the same voice of Prince Andrei said gently and tenderly.

The postilion touched up the horses, and the wheels of the carriage rumbled. Prince Ippolit laughed fitfully, standing on the porch and waiting for the viscount, whom he had promised to take home.

�Eh, bien, mon cher, votre petite princesse est tr&#232;s bien, tr&#232;s bien,� said the viscount, getting into the carriage with Ippolit. �Mais tr&#232;s bien.� He kissed the tips of his fingers. �Et tout-&#224;-fait fran&#231;aise.�

Ippolit laughed with a snort.

�Et savez-vous que vous &#234;tes terrible avec votre petit air innocent,� the viscount continued. �Je plains le pauvre mari, ce petit officier, qui se donne des airs de prince r&#233;gnant.�

Ippolit snorted again and said through his laughter:

�Et vous disiez, que les dames russes ne valaient pas les dames fran&#231;aises. Il faut savoir s�y prendre.�

Pierre, arriving first, went to Prince Andrei�s study, being a familiar of the house, and, as was his habit, at once lay down on the sofa, took the first book that caught his eye from the shelf (it was Caesar�s Commentaries), and, leaning on his elbow, began reading it from the middle.

�What have you done to mademoiselle Scherer? She�ll be quite ill now,� said Prince Andrei, coming into his study and rubbing his small white hands.

Pierre swung his whole body so that the sofa creaked, turned his animated face to Prince Andrei, smiled, and waved his hand.

�No, that abb&#233; is very interesting, only he has the wrong notion of things�In my opinion, eternal peace is possible, but I don�t know how to say it�Only it�s not through political balance��

Prince Andrei was obviously not interested in these abstract conversations.

�Mon cher, you can�t go saying what you think everywhere. Well, so, have you finally decided on anything? Are you going to be a horse guard or a diplomat?� Prince Andrei asked after a moment�s silence.

Pierre sat up on the sofa with both legs tucked under him.

�Can you imagine, I still don�t know. I don�t like either of them.�

�But you must decide on something. Your father�s waiting.�

At the age of ten, Pierre had been sent abroad with an abb&#233;-tutor and had remained there until he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow, his father dismissed the abb&#233; and said to the young man: �Go to Petersburg now, look around, and choose. I�ll agree to anything. Here�s a letter to Prince Vassily, and here�s some money. Write to me about everything, I�ll help you in everything.� Pierre had been choosing a career for three months already and had done nothing. This was the choice that Prince Andrei was talking about with him. Pierre rubbed his forehead.

�But he must be a Mason,� he said, meaning the abb&#233; he had seen at the soir&#233;e.

�That�s all rubbish,� Prince Andrei stopped him again, �better let�s talk about business. Have you been to the horse guards?��

�No, I haven�t, but here�s what�s come into my head and I wanted to tell you. There�s war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for freedom, I could understand it, I�d be the first to go into military service; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world�is not right.�

Prince Andrei merely shrugged his shoulders at Pierre�s childish talk. He made it look as though he could not reply to such stupidity; but in fact it was hard to reply to this na&#239;ve question in any other way than Prince Andrei had done.

�If everyone made war only according to his own convictions, there would be no war,� he said.

�And that would be excellent,� said Pierre.

Prince Andrei smiled.

�It might very well be excellent, but it will never happen��

�Well, what makes you go to war?� asked Pierre.

�What makes me? I don�t know. I have to. Besides, I�m going�� He paused. �I�m going because this life I lead here, this life�is not for me!�


VI

There was the rustle of a woman�s dress in the next room. Prince Andrei shook himself as if coming to his senses, and his face took on the same expression it had had in Anna Pavlovna�s drawing room. Pierre lowered his legs from the sofa. The princess came in. She had already changed to a house dress, but one just as elegant and fresh. Prince Andrei stood up, politely moving an armchair for her.

�Why is it, I often wonder,� she began, in French as always, hurriedly and fussily sitting down in the armchair, �why is it that Annette has never married? How stupid you all are, messieurs, not to have married her. Forgive me, but you understand nothing about women. You�re such an arguer, M�sieur Pierre.�

�I also keep arguing with your husband. I don�t understand why he wants to go to the war,� said Pierre, without any constraint (so usual in the relations of a young man with a young woman), turning to the princess.

The princess gave a flutter. Evidently Pierre�s words had touched her to the quick.

�Ah, that�s just what I say!� she said. �I don�t understand, I decidedly do not understand, why men can�t live without war. Why is it that we women want none of it and have no need of it? Well, you be the judge. I keep telling him: here he�s his uncle�s adjutant, a most brilliant position. He�s so well-known, so appreciated by everyone. The other day at the Apraksins� I heard a lady ask: �C�est &#231;a le fameux prince Andr&#233;?� Ma parole d�honneur!� she laughed. �He�s so well received everywhere. He could easily become an imperial adjutant. You know, the sovereign spoke to him very graciously. Annette and I were saying that it could easily be arranged. What do you think?�

Pierre looked at Prince Andrei and, noticing that his friend did not like this conversation, made no reply.

�When do you go?� he asked.

�Ah! ne me parlez pas de ce d&#233;part, ne m�en parlez pas. Je ne veux pas en entendre parler,� the princess said in the same capriciously playful tone in which she had spoken with Ippolit in the drawing room and which was so obviously unsuited to the family circle, where Pierre was like a member. �Today, when I thought how I�d have to break off all these dear relations�And then, you know, Andr&#233;?� She winked meaningfully at her husband. �J�ai peur, j�ai peur!� she whispered, her back shuddering.

Her husband looked at her as if he was surprised to notice there was someone else in the room besides himself and Pierre. However, with cold politeness he inquiringly addressed his wife:

�What are you afraid of, Liza? I cannot understand,� he said.

�See what egoists all men are; all, all egoists! For the sake of his whims, God knows why, he abandons me, he locks me up in the country alone.�

�With my father and sister, don�t forget,� Prince Andrei said quietly.

�Alone all the same, without my friends�And he wants me not to be afraid.�

Her tone was querulous now, her little lip rose, giving her face not a joyful but an animalish, squirrel-like expression. She fell silent, as if finding it indecent to speak of her pregnancy in front of Pierre, though that was where the essence of the matter lay.

�I still haven�t understood de quoi vous avez peur,� Prince Andrei said slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.

The princess blushed and waved her hands desperately.

�Non, Andr&#233;, je dis que vous avez tellement, tellement chang&#233;��

�Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,� said Prince Andrei. �You should get some sleep.�

The princess said nothing, and her short lip with its little mustache suddenly trembled. Prince Andrei, getting up and shrugging his shoulders, began to pace the room.

Pierre gazed wonderingly and na&#239;vely through his spectacles now at him, now at the princess, and stirred as if he also wanted to get up, but changed his mind again.

�What do I care if M�sieur Pierre is here,� the little princess said suddenly, and her pretty face suddenly spread into a tearful grimace. �I�ve long wanted to say to you, Andr&#233;: why have you changed so much towards me? What have I done to you? You�re going into the army, you have no pity for me. Why is it?�

�Lise!� was all Prince Andrei said; but in this word there was an entreaty, and a threat, and above all the conviction that she herself would regret her words; but she hurriedly went on:

�You treat me like a sick person or a child. I see it all. You weren�t like this six months ago.�

�Lise, I beg you to stop,� Prince Andrei said still more expressively.

Pierre, who was becoming more and more agitated during this conversation, got up and went over to the princess. He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was about to start crying himself.

�Calm yourself, Princess. It seems so to you, because, I assure you, I myself have experienced�why�because�No, excuse me, an outsider is in the way here�No, calm yourself�Good-bye��

Prince Andrei caught him by the arm.

�No, wait, Pierre. The princess is so good that she will not want to deprive me of the pleasure of spending an evening with you.�

�No, he thinks only of himself,� said the princess, not holding back her angry tears.

�Lise,� Prince Andrei said drily, raising his tone to a degree which showed that his patience had run out.

Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression on the princess�s beautiful little face changed to an attractive and compassion-provoking expression of fear; her pretty eyes glanced from under her eyebrows at her husband, and her face acquired the timid and admissive look of a dog rapidly but weakly wagging its drooping tail.

�Mon dieu, mon dieu!� said the princess, and taking up a fold of her dress in one hand, she went over to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.

�Bonsoir, Lise,� said Prince Andrei, standing up and kissing her hand politely, as if she were a stranger.

The friends were silent. Neither of them would begin talking. Pierre kept glancing at Prince Andrei; Prince Andrei was rubbing his forehead with his small hand.

�Let�s go and have supper,� he said with a sigh, getting up and heading for the door.

They went into the elegantly, newly, richly decorated dining room. Everything from the napkins to the silverware, china, and crystal bore that special stamp of newness that is found in the households of the recently married. In the middle of supper, the prince leaned his elbow on the table and, with an expression of nervous irritation such as Pierre had never seen in his friend before, began to talk, like a man who has long had something on his heart and suddenly decides to speak it out:

�Never, never marry, my friend. Here�s my advice to you: don�t marry until you can tell yourself that you�ve done all you could, and until you�ve stopped loving the woman you�ve chosen, until you see her clearly, otherwise you�ll be cruelly and irremediably mistaken. Marry when you�re old and good for nothing�Otherwise all that�s good and lofty in you will be lost. It will all go on trifles. Yes, yes, yes! Don�t look at me with such astonishment. If you expect something from yourself in the future, then at every step you�ll feel that it�s all over for you, it�s all closed, except the drawing room, where you�ll stand on the same level as a court flunkey and an idiot�Ah, well!��

He waved his hand energetically.

Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face change, expressing still more kindness, and looked at his friend in astonishment.

�My wife,� Prince Andrei went on, �is a wonderful woman. She�s one of those rare women with whom one can be at ease regarding one�s own honor; but, my God, what wouldn�t I give now not to be married! You�re the first and only one I�m saying this to, because I love you.�

Prince Andrei, in saying this, was less than ever like that Bolkonsky who sat sprawled in Anna Pavlovna�s armchair and, narrowing his eyes, uttered French phrases through his teeth. His dry face was all aquiver with the nervous animation of every muscle; his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now shone with a bright, radiant brilliance. One could see that, the more lifeless he seemed in ordinary times, the more energetic he was in moments of irritation.

�You don�t understand why I�m saying this,� he went on. �Yet it�s a whole life�s story. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,� he said, though Pierre had not talked of Bonaparte. �You talk of Bonaparte; but Bonaparte, when he was working, went step by step towards his goal, he was free, he had nothing except his goal�and he reached it. But bind yourself to a woman�and, like a prisoner in irons, you lose all freedom. And whatever hope and strength you have in you, it all only burdens and torments you with remorse. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, triviality�that is the vicious circle I can�t get out of. I�m now going to the war, to the greatest war that has ever been, yet I know nothing and am good for nothing. Je suis tr&#232;s aimable et tr&#232;s caustique,� Prince Andrei went on, �and they listen to me at Anna Pavlovna�s. And this stupid society, without which my wife cannot live, and these women�If you only knew what toutes les femmes distingu&#233;es and women in general really are! My father is right. Egoism, vanity, dull-wittedness, triviality in everything�that�s women, when they show themselves as they are. Looking at them in society, it seems there�s something there, but there�s nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don�t marry, dear heart, don�t marry,� Prince Andrei concluded.

�I find it funny,� said Pierre, �that you, you yourself, consider that you have no ability and that your life is a ruined life. You have everything, everything ahead of you. And you��

He did not say you what, but his tone already showed how highly he valued his friend and how much he expected from him in the future.

�How can he say that!� thought Pierre. Pierre considered Prince Andrei the model of all perfections, precisely because Prince Andrei united in the highest degree all those qualities which Pierre did not possess and which could be most nearly expressed by the notion of strength of will. Pierre always marveled at Prince Andrei�s ability to deal calmly with all sorts of people, at his extraordinary memory, his erudition (he had read everything, knew everything, had notions about everything), and most of all at his ability to work and learn. If Pierre had often been struck by Andrei�s lack of ability for dreamy philosophizing (for which Pierre had a particular inclination), he saw it not as a defect, but as a strength.

In the best, the friendliest and simplest relations, flattery or praise is necessary, just as grease is necessary to keep wheels turning.

�Je suis un homme fini,� said Prince Andrei. �Why talk about me? Let�s talk about you,� he said, pausing and smiling at his comforting thoughts. This smile was instantly reflected on Pierre�s face.

�But what is there to say about me?� asked Pierre, spreading his mouth into a carefree, merry smile. �What am I? Je suis un b&#226;tard!� And he suddenly flushed crimson. One could see that it had cost him great effort to say that. �Sans nom, sans fortune �And what, really�� But he did not say what really. �I�m free so far, and I feel fine. Only I have no idea where to make my start. I seriously wanted to ask your advice.�

Prince Andrei looked at him with kindly eyes. But in his friendly, gentle gaze a consciousness of his own superiority still showed.

�You�re dear to me especially because you�re the only live person in our whole society. That�s fine for you. Choose whatever you like; it�s all the same. You�ll be fine anywhere, but there�s one thing: stop going to those Kuragins and leading that sort of life. It simply doesn�t suit you: all this carousing with hussars, and all��

�Que voulez-vous, mon cher,� said Pierre, shrugging his shoulders, �les femmes, mon cher, les femmes!�

�I don�t understand,� replied Andrei. �Les femmes comme il faut are another matter; but les femmes of Kuragin, les femmes et le vin, I don�t understand!�

Pierre lived at Prince Vassily Kuragin�s and took part in the dissolute life of his son Anatole, the same one they planned to marry to Prince Andrei�s sister in order to reform him.

�You know what?� said Pierre, as if a lucky thought had unexpectedly occurred to him. �Seriously, I�ve been thinking that for a long time. With this life I can�t decide or even consider anything. I have a headache and no money. He invited me tonight, but I won�t go.�

�Give me your word of honor that you won�t go anymore?�

�Word of honor!�

It was already past one o�clock when Pierre left his friend�s house. It was a duskless Petersburg June night. Pierre got into a hired carriage with the intention of going home. But the closer he came, the more he felt the impossibility of falling asleep on that night, which more resembled an evening or a morning. One could see far down the empty streets. On the way, Pierre recalled that the usual gambling company was to gather at Anatole Kuragin�s that evening, after which there was usually drinking, ending with one of Pierre�s favorite amusements.

�It would be nice to go to Kuragin�s,� he thought. But at once he remembered the word of honor he had given Prince Andrei not to visit Kuragin.

But at once, as happens with so-called characterless people, he desired so passionately to experience again that dissolute life so familiar to him, that he decided to go. And at once the thought occurred to him that the word he had given meant nothing, because before giving his word to Prince Andrei, he had also given Prince Anatole his word that he would be there; finally he thought that all these words of honor were mere conventions, with no definite meaning, especially if you considered that you might die the next day, or something so extraordinary might happen to you that there would no longer be either honor or dishonor. That sort of reasoning often came to Pierre, destroying all his decisions and suppositions. He went to Kuragin�s.

Driving up to the porch of a large house near the horse guards� barracks, in which Anatole lived, he went up the lighted porch, the stairs, and entered an open door. There was no one in the front hall; empty bottles, capes, galoshes were lying about; there was a smell of wine, the noise of distant talking and shouting.

Cards and supper were over, but the guests had not dispersed yet. Pierre threw off his cape and went into the first room, where the remains of supper lay and one lackey, thinking no one could see him, was finishing on the sly what was left of the wine in the glasses. From the third room came a racket, guffawing, the shouting of familiar voices, and the roaring of a bear. Some eight young men were crowded busily by an open window. Three were romping with a young bear, one of them dragging it by a chain, trying to frighten the others.

�I stake a hundred on Stevens!� shouted one.

�Make sure there�s no holding on!� shouted another.

�I�m for Dolokhov!� cried a third. �Break the grip, Kuragin.�

�Let Bruin be, we�re making a bet.�

�At one go, otherwise you lose,� shouted a fourth.

�Yakov! Let�s have a bottle, Yakov!� shouted the host himself, a tall, handsome man, who was standing in the midst of the crowd in nothing but a fine shirt open on his chest. �Wait, gentlemen. Here�s Petrusha, my dear friend,� he turned to Pierre.

Another voice, that of a not very tall man with clear blue eyes, especially striking amidst all these drunken voices by its sober expression, shouted from the window: �Come here�break the grip!� This was Dolokhov, an officer of the Semyonovsky regiment, a notorious gambler and duellist, who lived with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking around merrily.

�I don�t understand a thing. What�s up?� he asked.

�Wait, he�s not drunk. Give me a bottle,� said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table, he went up to Pierre.

�First of all, drink.�

Pierre started drinking glass after glass, looking from under his brows at the drunken guests, who again crowded by the window, and listening to their talk. Anatole poured the wine for him and told him that Dolokhov was making a bet with the Englishman Stevens, a sailor who was there, that he, Dolokhov, could drink a bottle of rum sitting in the third-floor window with his legs hanging out.

�Well, drink it all,� said Anatole, handing Pierre the last glass, �otherwise I won�t let you go!�

�No, I don�t want to,� said Pierre, pushing Anatole away, and he went over to the window.

Dolokhov was holding the Englishman by the hand and clearly, distinctly articulating the terms of the bet, mainly addressing Anatole and Pierre.

Dolokhov was a man of medium height, curly-haired and with light blue eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers, he wore no mustache, and his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was entirely visible. The lines of his mouth were remarkably finely curved. In the middle, the upper lip came down energetically on the sturdy lower lip in a sharp wedge, and at the corners something like two smiles were constantly formed, one on each side; and all of that together, especially combined with a firm, insolent, intelligent gaze, made up such an expression that it was impossible not to notice this face. Dolokhov was not a rich man and had no connections. And though Anatole ran through tens of thousands, Dolokhov lived with him and managed to place himself so that Anatole and all those who knew them respected Dolokhov more than Anatole. Dolokhov gambled at all games and almost always won. No matter how much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness. Kuragin and Dolokhov were both celebrities at that time in the world of Petersburg scapegraces and carousers.

A bottle of rum was brought. Two lackeys were tearing out the frame that prevented one from sitting on the outer ledge of the window; they were obviously hurrying and intimidated by the orders and shouts of the surrounding gentlemen.

Anatole went up to the window with his victorious look. He wanted to break something. He pushed the lackeys away and pulled at the frame, but the frame did not yield. He smashed a pane.

�You next, strongman,� he turned to Pierre.

Pierre took hold of the crosspieces, pulled, and, with a crash, here broke and there ripped out the oak frame.

�Away with all of it, otherwise they�ll think I�m holding on,� said Dolokhov.

�The Englishman�s boasting�eh?�all right?�� said Anatole.

�All right,� said Pierre, looking at Dolokhov, who, holding the bottle of rum in his hand, was approaching the window, through which the light of the sky could be seen and the glow of morning and evening merging in it.

Dolokhov jumped up into the window with the bottle of rum in his hand.

�Listen!� he shouted, standing on the windowsill and turning to the room. Everyone fell silent.

�I put down� (he spoke in French so that the Englishman would understand him, and he did not speak the language all that well), �I put down fifty imperials�want to make it a hundred?� he added, addressing the Englishman.

�No, fifty,� said the Englishman.

�Very well, fifty imperials, that I will drink a whole bottle of rum, without taking it from my lips, drink it sitting outside the window, on this place� (he bent down and indicated the sloping ledge outside the window), �and without holding on to anything�Right?��

�Very good,� said the Englishman.

Anatole turned to the Englishman and, taking him by the button of his tailcoat and looking at him from above (the Englishman was short), began repeating the terms of the bet to him in English.

�Wait,� cried Dolokhov, tapping the bottle against the window to attract attention. �Wait, Kuragin; listen. If anybody else does the same, I�ll pay him a hundred imperials. Understood?�

The Englishman nodded his head, in no way making clear whether he did or did not accept this new bet. Anatole did not let go of the Englishman, and though he had nodded to show he had understood everything, Anatole translated Dolokhov�s words into English for him. A young, lean boy, a life-hussar, who had gambled away everything that evening, climbed up on the window, stuck his head out, and looked down.

�Oooh!� he said, looking out the window at the stone of the pavement.

�Attention!� cried Dolokhov and pulled the officer from the window. Getting tangled in his spurs, the boy jumped down awkwardly into the room.

After placing the bottle on the windowsill to have it conveniently at hand, Dolokhov slowly and carefully climbed into the window. Lowering his legs and spreading both hands against the sides of the window, he tried his position, settled himself, let go with his hands, shifted a little to the right, to the left, and took the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and set them on the windowsill, though it was already quite light. Dolokhov�s back in its white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded by the window. The Englishman stood in front. Pierre smiled and said nothing. One of those present, older than the others, with a frightened and angry face, suddenly moved forward and was about to seize Dolokhov by the shirt.

�Gentlemen, this is stupid; he�ll kill himself,� said this more reasonable man.

Anatole stopped him.

�Don�t touch, you�ll frighten him, and he�ll be killed. Eh?�What then?�Eh?��

Dolokhov turned, adjusting his position, and again spreading his hands.

�If anybody else tries to get at me,� he said, slowly forcing the words through his compressed and thin lips, �I�ll chuck him down from here right now. So!��

Having said �So!� he turned back again, let go with his hands, took the bottle and put it to his lips, threw his head back, and thrust his free arm up for balance. One of the lackeys, who had begun picking up the glass, stopped in a bent position, not taking his eyes from the window and Dolokhov�s back. Anatole stood erect, his eyes gaping. The Englishman, his lips thrust out, watched from the side. The man who had tried to stop them rushed to the corner of the room and lay down on a sofa, face to the wall. Pierre covered his face, and a faint smile remained forgotten on it, though it now expressed terror and fear. Everyone was silent. Pierre took his hands away from his eyes. Dolokhov was sitting in the same position, only his head was thrown far back, so that the curly hair of his nape touched the collar of his shirt, and the hand holding the bottle rose higher and higher, trembling and making an effort. The bottle was apparently emptying and rising at the same time, pushing the head back. �Why is it taking so long?� thought Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had gone by. Suddenly Dolokhov made a backward movement, and his arm trembled nervously; this shudder was enough to shift his whole body, which was sitting on the sloping ledge. He shifted completely, and his arm and head trembled still more from the effort. One arm rose to take hold of the windowsill, but lowered itself again. Pierre again shut his eyes and said to himself that he was never going to open them. Suddenly he felt everything around him stirring. He looked: Dolokhov was standing on the windowsill, his face pale and merry.

�Empty!�

He tossed the bottle to the Englishman, who deftly caught it. Dolokhov jumped down from the window. He smelled strongly of rum.

�Excellent! Good boy! There�s a bet for you! Devil take you all!� they cried on all sides.

The Englishman, having produced his purse, counted out the money. Dolokhov frowned and said nothing. Pierre climbed into the window.

�Gentlemen! Who wants to make a bet with me? I�ll do the same thing,� he suddenly shouted. �And there�s no need for a bet, that�s what. Tell them to bring a bottle. I�ll do it�tell them.�

�Let him, let him!� said Dolokhov, smiling.

�What, have you lost your mind? Who�d let you? You get dizzy on the stairs,� came from various sides.

�I�ll drink it, give me a bottle of rum!� Pierre cried, pounding the table with a determined and drunken gesture, and he climbed into the window.

They seized him by the arms; but he was so strong that he pushed those who came near him far away.

�No, you won�t get anywhere with him that way,� said Anatole. �Wait, I�ll trick him. Listen, I�ll make a bet with you, but tomorrow, and now let�s all go to the * * *.�

�Let�s go,� cried Pierre, �let�s go!�And we�ll take Bruin with us��

And he seized the bear and, hugging him and lifting him up, began waltzing around the room with him.


VII

Prince Vassily fulfilled the promise he had given at Anna Pavlovna�s soir&#233;e to Princess Drubetskoy, who had solicited him for her only son Boris. A report on him was made to the sovereign, and, unlike others, he was transferred to the Semyonovsky guards regiment as an ensign. But Boris was not to be appointed adjutant or attach&#233; to Kutuzov, despite all Anna Mikhailovna�s soliciting and scheming. Soon after Anna Pavlovna�s soir&#233;e, Anna Mikhailovna returned to Moscow, straight to her rich relations, the Rostovs, with whom she stayed in Moscow, and with whom her adored Borenka, just made an ensign in the army and transferred to the guards, had been brought up and had lived for years. The guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in Moscow to equip himself, was to catch up with them on the way to Radzivilov.

At the Rostovs� it was the name day of the Natalyas, mother and younger daughter. Since morning, coach and sixes had constantly been driving up and leaving, bringing people with congratulations to the big house of the countess Rostov on Povarskaya Street, which was known to all Moscow. The countess with her beautiful older daughter and the guests, who constantly replaced each other, were sitting in the drawing room.

The countess was a woman with a thin, Oriental type of face, forty-five years old, evidently worn out by children, of whom she had had twelve. The slowness of her movements and speech, caused by weakness, gave her an air of importance that inspired respect. Princess Anna Mikhailovna Drubetskoy, as a member of the household, sat right there, helping with the business of receiving the guests and occupying them with conversation. The young people were in the back rooms, finding it unnecessary to take part in receiving visits. The count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner.

�Much obliged to you, ma ch&#232;re or mon cher� (he said ma ch&#232;re or mon cher to everyone without exception and without the slightest nuance, whether they were of higher or lower standing than himself), �for myself and the dear name-day ladies. See that you come for dinner. You�ll offend me if you don�t, mon cher. I cordially invite you on behalf of the whole family, ma ch&#232;re.� These words he said with the same expression on his full, cheerful, and clean-shaven face, with the same strong handshake and repeated short bows, to everyone without exception or variation. Having seen off a guest, the count would return to the gentleman or lady who was still in the drawing room; moving up an armchair, and with the look of a man who loves life and knows how to live it, spreading his legs dashingly and putting his hands on his knees, he would sway significantly, offer his surmises about the weather, discuss health, sometimes in Russian, sometimes in very poor but self-confident French, and again, with the look of a man weary but firm in the fulfillment of his duty, would go to see people off, smoothing the thin gray hair over his bald spot, and again invite them to dinner. Occasionally, on returning from the front hall, he would pass through the conservatory and the servants� room to a big marble hall, where a table of eighty settings was being laid, and, looking at the servants carrying silver and china, opening out tables, and spreading damask tablecloths, he would call Dmitri Vassilievich, a nobleman who managed all his affairs, and say:

�Well, well, Mitenka, see that it�s all nice. Right, right,� he would say, looking over the enormous, opened-out table. �The main thing�s the setout. So, so�� And, sighing self-contentedly, he would go back to the drawing room.

�Marya Lvovna Karagin with daughter!� the countess�s enormous footman announced in a bass voice, coming to the door of the drawing room. The countess pondered and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husband�s portrait on it.

�I�m worn out with these visits,� she said. �Well, she�ll be the last I receive. She�s so prim. Ask her in,� she said to the footman in a sad voice, as if to say: �Well, so finish me off.�

A tall, stout, proud-looking lady and her round-faced, smiling daughter came into the room, rustling their skirts.

�Ch&#232;re comtesse, il y a si longtemps�elle a &#233;t&#233; alit&#233;e, la pauvre enfant�au bal des Razoumowsky�et la comtesse Apraksine�j�ai &#233;t&#233; si heureuse�� women�s voices were heard, interrupting each other and merging with the rustling of skirts and the moving of chairs. That sort of conversation began which is designed to last just long enough so that one can get up at the first pause, with a rustling of skirts, say, �Je suis bien charm&#233;e; la sant&#233; de maman�et la comtesse Apraksine,� and again, with a rustling of skirts, go back to the front hall, put on a fur coat or a cloak, and drive off. The conversation turned to the main news of the town at that time�the illness of the rich and famous beau of Catherine�s time, old Count Bezukhov, and his illegitimate son Pierre, who had behaved so improperly at Anna Pavlovna Scherer�s soir&#233;e.

�I�m very sorry for the poor count,� said the guest. �He was in poor health to begin with, and now this distress on account of his son. It will kill him!�

�What do you mean?� asked the countess, as if she did not know what the guest was talking about, though she had already heard the cause of Count Bezukhov�s distress a good fifteen times.

�It�s modern upbringing! While still abroad,� the guest went on, �this young man was left to himself, and now in Petersburg, they say, he did such awful things that he�s been banished by the police.�

�You don�t say!� said the countess.

�He chose his acquaintances poorly,� Princess Anna Mikhailovna mixed in. �Prince Vassily�s son, he and a certain Dolokhov, they say, were up to God knows what. And they�ve both suffered for it. Dolokhov has been broken to the ranks, and Bezukhov�s son has been banished to Moscow. As for Anatole Kuragin�his father somehow hushed it up. But they did banish him from Petersburg.�

�Why, what on earth did they do?� asked the countess.

�They�re perfect ruffians, especially Dolokhov,� said the guest. �He�s the son of Marya Ivanovna Dolokhov, such a respectable lady, and what then? Can you imagine: the three of them found a bear somewhere, put it in the carriage with them, and went to the actresses. The police came running to quiet them down. They took a policeman and tied him back to back with the bear, and threw the bear into the Moika. So the bear goes swimming about with the policeman on him.�

�A fine figure the policeman must have cut, ma ch&#232;re,� cried the count, dying with laughter.

�Ah, how terrible! What is there to laugh at, Count?�

But the ladies could not help laughing themselves.

�They barely managed to save the poor fellow,� the guest went on. �That�s how intelligently the son of Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov amuses himself!� she added. �And I heard he was so well-bred and intelligent. There�s what all this foreign upbringing leads to. I hope no one receives him here, despite his wealth. They wanted to introduce him to me. I decidedly refused: I have daughters.�

�What makes you say this young man is so wealthy?� asked the countess, leaning away from the girls, who at once pretended they were not listening. �The man has only illegitimate children. It seems�Pierre, too, is illegitimate.�

The guest waved her hand.

�He has a score of them, I should think.�

Princess Anna Mikhailovna mixed into the conversation, clearly wishing to show her connections and her knowledge of all the circumstances of society.

�The thing is this,� she said significantly and also in a half whisper. �Count Kirill Vladimirovich�s reputation is well-known�He�s lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.�

�How good-looking the old man was,� said the countess, �even last year! I�ve never seen a handsomer man.�

�He�s quite changed now,� said Anna Mikhailovna. �So, as I was about to say,� she went on, �Prince Vassily is the direct heir to the whole fortune through his wife, but the father loved Pierre very much, concerned himself with his upbringing, and wrote to the sovereign�so that when he dies (he�s so poorly that they expect it any moment, and Lorrain has come from Petersburg), no one knows who will get this enormous fortune, Pierre or Prince Vassily. Forty thousand souls, and millions of roubles. I know it very well, because Prince Vassily told me himself. And Kirill Vladimirovich is my uncle twice removed through my mother. And he�s Borya�s godfather,� she added, as if ascribing no importance to this circumstance.

�Prince Vassily came to Moscow yesterday. He�s going to do some inspecting, I�m told,� said the guest.

�Yes, but entre nous,� said the countess, �it�s a pretext. He�s come, essentially, to see Count Kirill Vladimirovich, having learned that he was so poorly.�

�However, ma ch&#232;re, that was a nice stunt,� said the count and, noticing that the elder guest was not listening, he turned to the young ladies. �A fine figure that policeman cut, I imagine.�

And, picturing how the policeman waved his arms, he again burst into resounding, bass-voiced laughter, which shook his whole stout body, as people laugh who always eat, and especially drink, very well. �So please do come for dinner,� he said.


VIII

Silence ensued. The countess looked at the guest with a pleasant smile, without concealing, however, that she would not be upset in the least now if the guest got up and left. The guest�s daughter was already smoothing her dress, looking questioningly at her mother, when suddenly from the neighboring room came the sound of several men�s and women�s feet running to the door, the crash of a tripped-over and fallen chair, and a thirteen-year-old girl ran in, bundling something in her short muslin skirt, and stopped in the middle of the room. It was obvious that she had run so far inadvertently, miscalculating the distance. At the same moment a student in a raspberry-colored collar, an officer of the guards, a fifteen-year-old girl, and a fat, red-cheeked boy in a child�s jacket appeared in the doorway.

The count jumped up and, swaying, spread his arms wide around the running girl.

�Ah, here she is!� he shouted, laughing. �The name-day girl! Ma ch&#232;re name-day girl!�

�Ma ch&#232;re, il y a un temps pour tout,� said the countess, feigning sternness. �You always spoil her, &#201;lie,� she added to her husband.

�Bonjour, ma ch&#232;re, je vous f&#233;licite,� said the guest. �Quelle d&#233;licieuse enfant!� she added, turning to the mother.

The dark-eyed, big-mouthed, not beautiful, but lively girl, with her child�s bare shoulders popping out of her bodice from running fast, with her black ringlets all thrown back, her thin, bare arms, her little legs in lace-trimmed knickers and low shoes, was at that sweet age when a girl is no longer a child, but the child is not yet a young lady. Wriggling out of her father�s arms, she ran to her mother and, paying no attention to her stern remark, buried her flushed face in her mother�s lace mantilla and laughed. She laughed at something, talking fitfully about the doll she took out from under her skirt.

�You see?�My doll�Mimi�You see��

And Natasha could say no more (everything seemed funny to her). She fell on her mother and burst into such loud and ringing laughter that everyone else, even the prim guest, laughed involuntarily.

�Well, off you go, off you go, you and that ugly thing!� said the mother, pushing her daughter away with feigned gruffness. �This is my younger one,� she turned to her guest.

Natasha, tearing her face momentarily from her mother�s lace wrap, looked up at her through tears of laughter and hid her face again.

The guest, forced to admire the family scene, found it necessary to take some part in it.

�Tell me, my dear,� she said, addressing Natasha, �what is this Mimi to you? Your daughter, it must be?�

Natasha did not like the tone of condescension to childish talk in which the guest addressed her. She made no reply and gave the guest a serious look.

Meanwhile all this younger generation�Boris, the officer, son of Princess Anna Mikhailovna; Nikolai, the student, the count�s eldest son; Sonya, the count�s fifteen-year-old niece; and little Petrusha, the youngest son�all settled themselves in the drawing room and obviously tried to keep within the limits of propriety the animation and gaiety which their every feature still breathed. It was clear that there in the back rooms, from which they had all come running so precipitously, the talk was merrier than the talk here about town gossip, the weather, and the comtesse Apraksine. They glanced at each other from time to time and could barely hold back their laughter.

The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood, were of the same age and both handsome, but they did not resemble each other. Boris was a tall, blond youth with the regular, fine features of a calm and handsome face. Nikolai was a curly-haired young man, not very tall, and with an open expression of the face. On his upper lip a little black hair had already appeared, and his whole face expressed impetuousness and rapturousness. Nikolai blushed as soon as he came into the drawing room. One could see that he was searching for something to say and could not find it. Boris, on the other hand, got his bearings at once and told calmly, jokingly, how he had known this Mimi, the doll, when she was still a young girl, with an unspoiled nose, how she had grown old in the five years he remembered, and how her head had gotten cracked across the entire skull. Having said this, he glanced at Natasha. Natasha turned away from him, glanced at her younger brother, who, with his eyes shut tight, was shaking with soundless laughter, and, unable to hold herself back any longer, jumped down and ran out of the room as fast as her quick feet would carry her. Boris did not laugh.

�I believe you also wanted to go, maman? Do you need a carriage?� he said, turning to his mother with a smile.

�Yes, go, go, tell them to make ready,� she said, smiling.

Boris quietly went to the door and followed Natasha out; the fat boy angrily ran after them, as if vexed at the disturbance that had interfered with his pursuits.


IX

Of the young people, not including the countess�s elder daughter (who was four years older than her sister and already behaved like an adult), and the young lady guest, only Nikolai and the niece Sonya remained in the drawing room. Sonya was a slender, diminutive brunette with a soft gaze shaded by long eyelashes, a thick black braid wound twice around her head, and a sallow tinge to the skin of her face and especially of her bared, lean, but gracefully muscular arms and neck. In the smoothness of her movements, the softness and suppleness of her small limbs, and her somewhat sly and reserved manner, she resembled a pretty but not yet fully formed kitten, which would one day be a lovely little cat. She evidently considered it the proper thing to show by a smile her interest in the general conversation; but, against her will, her eyes under their long, thick lashes kept looking with such passionate girlish adoration at her cousin, who was leaving for the army, that her smile could not deceive anyone for a moment, and it was clear that the little cat crouched down only in order to leap up more energetically and play with her cousin as soon as they, like Boris and Natasha, could get out of this drawing room.

�Yes, ma ch&#232;re,� said the old count, addressing the guest and pointing to his Nikolai. �Here his friend Boris has just been made an officer, and out of friendship he doesn�t want to lag behind; he�s leaving both the university and his old father: he�s going into the army, ma ch&#232;re. And a post had already been prepared for him in the archives and all. Isn�t that friendship?� the count said questioningly.

�Yes, they say war has been declared,� said the guest.

�They�ve been saying it for a long time,� said the count. �Again they�ll talk and talk and leave it at that. Ma ch&#232;re, that�s friendship!� he repeated. �He�s joining the hussars.�

The guest, not knowing what to say, shook her head.

�Not at all out of friendship,� replied Nikolai, blushing and protesting, as if it was a shameful calumny. �It�s not friendship, I simply feel a calling for military service.�

He shot a glance at his cousin and the young lady guest: they both looked at him with a smile of approval.

�Tonight Schubert will be dining with us, a colonel in the Pavlogradsky hussar regiment. He�s been on leave here and is taking him along. What to do?� said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking jokingly about a matter that obviously cost him much grief.

�I�ve already told you, papa,� said his son, �that if you don�t want to let me go, I�ll stay. But I know I�m not good for anything but military service; I�m not a diplomat, not a functionary, I�m unable to hide my feelings,� he said, glancing all the while with the coquetry of a handsome youth at Sonya and the young lady guest.

The little cat fixed her eyes on him and seemed ready at any instant to begin playing and show all her cat nature.

�Well, well, all right!� said the old count. �He keeps getting heated up. It�s this Bonaparte who�s turned all their heads; they all wonder how it is that from the lieutenants he landed among the emperors. Well, God grant it,� he added, not noticing the guest�s mocking smile.

The adults began talking about Bonaparte. Julie, Mme Karagin�s daughter, turned to the young Rostov:

�What a pity you weren�t at the Arkharovs� on Thursday. I was bored without you,� she said, smiling tenderly at him.

The flattered young man, with the coquettish smile of youth, sat closer to her and got into a separate conversation with the smiling Julie, completely unaware that his involuntary smile cut the heart of the blushing and falsely smiling Sonya with the knife of jealousy. In the middle of the conversation, he turned to look at her. Sonya gave him a passionately angry look and, barely holding back the tears in her eyes, with a false smile on her lips, got up and left the room. All of Nikolai�s animation vanished. He waited for the first lull in the conversaton and with an upset face left the room to look for Sonya.

�How crystal clear all these young ones� secrets are!� said Anna Mikhailovna, pointing to Nikolai as he left. �Cousinage dangereux voisinage,� she added.

�Yes,� said the countess, when the ray of sunlight that had penetrated the room with the young generation vanished, and as if answering a question no one had asked her, but which constantly preoccupied her. �So much suffering, so much anxiety endured so as to rejoice in them now! And now, too, there�s really more fear than joy. One is afraid, always afraid! It�s precisely the age when there are so many dangers both for girls and for boys.�

�Everything depends on upbringing,� said the guest.

�Yes, true for you,� the countess went on. �Up to now, thank God, I�ve been a friend to my children and have enjoyed their full trust,� said the countess, repeating the error of many parents who suppose that their children have no secrets from them. �I know that I�ll always be my daughters� first confidente and that if Nikolenka, with his fiery character, gets up to some mischief (boys can�t do without it), it still won�t be the same as with these Petersburg gentlemen.�

�Yes, nice, nice children,� agreed the count, who always resolved all tangled questions by finding everything nice. �Just look at him! Decided to be a hussar! Well, what do you want, ma ch&#232;re!�

�What a sweet creature your younger one is!� said the guest. �A ball of fire!�

�Yes, a ball of fire,� said the count. �She takes after me! And what a voice! Though she�s my daughter, I�ll tell you the truth: she�ll be a singer, another Salomoni. We�ve hired an Italian to teach her.�

�Isn�t it too early? They say it harms the voice to study at that age.�

�Oh, no, not too early at all!� said the count. �How is it, then, that our mothers got married when they were twelve or thirteen?�

�She�s already in love with Boris now! What a one!� said the countess, smiling quietly, looking at Boris�s mother, and, evidently responding to the thought that always preoccupied her, she went on: �Well, so you see, if I were strict with her, if I forbade her�God knows what they�d do on the sly� (the countess meant they would be kissing), �but now I know her every word. She�ll come running to me herself in the evening and tell me everything. I may be spoiling her, but it really seems better. I was strict with the elder one.�

�Yes, I was brought up quite differently,� said the elder one, the beautiful Countess Vera, smiling.

But the smile did not embellish Vera�s face, as usually happens; on the contrary, her face became unnatural and therefore unpleasant. The elder one, Vera, was good-looking, far from stupid, an excellent student, well-brought-up, had a pleasant voice, and what she said was correct and appropriate; but, strangely, everyone, both the guest and the countess, turned to look at her, as if wondering why she had said it, and they felt awkward.

�One is always too clever with the older children, wanting to do something extraordinary,� said the guest.

�There�s no use denying it, ma ch&#232;re! The dear countess was too clever with Vera,� said the count. �Well, so what! She still turned out nice,� he added, winking at Vera approvingly.

The guests got up and left, promising to come for dinner.

�What manners! They sat and sat!� said the countess, after seeing the guests off.

When Natasha left the drawing room and ran off, she ran no further than the conservatory. In that room she stopped, listening to the talk in the drawing room and waiting for Boris to come out. She was already growing impatient and, stamping her little foot, was about to cry because he did not come at once, when she heard the neither slow nor quick, but proper footsteps of the young man. Natasha quickly darted among the tubs of plants and hid herself.

Boris stopped in the middle of the room, looking around, brushed some specks of dust off the sleeve of his uniform with his hand, and went up to a mirror, studying his handsome face. Natasha kept still, peeking from her ambush, waiting to see what he would do. He stood for some time before the mirror, smiled, and walked to the other door. Natasha was about to call him, but then changed her mind.

�Let him search,� she said to herself. As soon as Boris left, the flushed Sonya came from the other door, whispering something spitefully through her tears. Natasha restrained her first impulse to rush out to her and remained in her ambush, as if under the cap of invisibility, observing what went on in the world. She experienced a special new pleasure. Sonya was whispering something and kept looking back at the door of the drawing room. Nikolai came out of that door.

�Sonya! what�s wrong? how can you?� said Nikolai, rushing to her.

�Never mind, never mind, leave me alone!� Sonya burst into sobs.

�No, I know what it is.�

�So you know, and that�s wonderful, and so go to her.�

�So-o-onya! One word! How can you torment me and yourself so because of a fantasy?� said Nikolai, taking her hand.

Sonya did not pull her hand away and stopped crying.

Natasha, motionless and breathless, with shining eyes, watched from behind her ambush. �What will happen now?� she thought.

�Sonya! The whole world is no use to me! You alone are everything,� said Nikolai. �I�ll prove it to you.�

�I don�t like it when you talk like that.�

�Well, then I won�t, well, forgive me, Sonya!� He drew her to him and kissed her.

�Ah, how nice!� thought Natasha, and when Sonya and Nikolai left the room, she went out after them and called Boris.

�Boris, come here,� she said with a significant and sly air. �There�s something I must tell you. Here, here,� she said and led him to the conservatory, to the place between the tubs where she had been hiding. Boris, smiling, followed her.

�What is this something?� he asked.

She became embarrassed, looked around, and, seeing her doll abandoned on a tub, took it in her hands.

�Kiss the doll,� she said.

Boris looked into her animated face with attentive, gentle eyes and said nothing.

�You don�t want to? Well, come here, then,� she said and went deeper among the plants and dropped her doll. �Closer, closer!� she whispered. She caught the officer by the cuffs with both hands, and her flushed face showed solemnity and fear.

�And do you want to kiss me?� she whispered barely audibly, looking at him from under her eyebrows, smiling and almost weeping with excitement.

Boris blushed.

�You�re so funny!� he said, bending down to her, blushing still more, but not undertaking anything and waiting.

She suddenly jumped up onto a tub, becoming taller than he, embraced him with her thin, bare arms, which bent higher than his neck, and, tossing her hair back with a movement of the head, kissed him right on the lips.

She slipped between the pots to the other side of the plants and stopped, her head lowered.

�Natasha,� he said, �you know I love you, but��

�You�re in love with me?� Natasha interrupted.

�Yes, I am, but, please, let�s not do like just now�Another four years�Then I�ll ask for your hand.�

Natasha reflected.

�Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen�� she said, counting on her thin little fingers. �All right! So it�s settled?�

And a smile of joy and reassurance lit up her animated face.

�Settled!� said Boris.

�Forever?� said the girl. �Till death?�

And, taking him under the arm, with a happy face she slowly walked beside him to the sitting room.


XI

The countess was so tired out from the visits that she ordered no one else to be received, and the porter was told simply to be sure to invite for dinner everyone who came by with congratulations. The countess wanted to talk personally with her childhood friend, Princess Anna Mikhailovna, whom she had not seen properly since her return from Petersburg. Anna Mikhailovna, with her weepy and pleasant face, moved closer to the countess�s armchair.

�I�ll be perfectly frank with you,� said Anna Mikhailovna. �There are few of us old friends left! That�s why I cherish your friendship so much.�

Anna Mikhailovna looked at Vera and stopped. The countess pressed her friend�s hand.

�Vera,� said the countess, turning to her older daughter, obviously not her favorite. �How is it you have no notion of anything? Can�t you feel that you�re not needed here? Go to your sisters, or��

The beautiful Vera smiled disdainfully, apparently not feeling the slightest offense.

�If you had told me long ago, mama, I would have left at once,� she said and went to her room. But, passing through the sitting room, she noticed two couples sitting symmetrically by the two windows. She stopped and smiled disdainfully. Sonya was sitting close to Nikolai, who was writing out some verses for her, the first he had ever written. Boris and Natasha were sitting by the other window and fell silent when Vera came in. Sonya and Natasha looked at Vera with guilty and happy faces.

It was amusing and touching to look at these enamoured girls, but the sight of them evidently did not arouse any pleasant feelings in Vera.

�How many times have I asked you not to take my things,� she said. �You have a room of your own.� She took the inkstand from Nikolai.

�Just a moment,� he said, dipping his pen.

�You manage to do everything at the wrong time,� said Vera. �The way you came running into the drawing room just now, everyone was ashamed of you.�

In spite of, or precisely because of, the fact that what she said was perfectly correct, no one answered her, and the four only exchanged glances with each other. She lingered in the room, with the inkstand in her hand.

�And what secrets can there be at your age between Natasha and Boris and between you two? It�s all silliness!�

�Well, what does it matter to you, Vera?� Natasha said pleadingly in a quiet little voice.

Clearly, that day she was being kinder and more affectionate with everyone than ever.

�Very silly,� said Vera. �I�m ashamed of you. Why secrets?�

�We all have our secrets. We don�t bother you and Berg,� Natasha said, flaring up.

�Of course you don�t,� said Vera, �because there can never be anything bad in my actions. But I shall tell mama how you behave with Boris.�

�Natalya Ilyinichna behaves very well with me,� said Boris. �I can�t complain,� he said.

�Stop it, Boris, you�re such a diplomat� (the word diplomat was much in vogue among children in that special sense they endowed it with); �it�s even boring,� Natasha said in an offended, trembling voice. �Why is she pestering me?�

�You�ll never understand it,� she said, turning to Vera, �because you�ve never loved anybody, you have no heart, you�re just a Madame de Genlis� (this nickname, considered very offensive, had been given to Vera by Nikolai), �and your highest pleasure is to do unpleasant things to others. Go and flirt with Berg as much as you like,� she said quickly.

�I certainly won�t go running after a young man in front of guests��

�Well, she�s done it,� Nikolai mixed in, �she�s said unpleasant things to everybody and upset everybody. Let�s go to the nursery.�

All four, like a frightened flock of birds, got up and left.

�They said unpleasant things to me, but I said nothing to anybody,� said Vera.

�Madame de Genlis, Madame de Genlis!� laughing voices said behind the door.

The beautiful Vera, who had such an irritating, unpleasant effect on everyone, smiled and, apparently untouched by what had been said to her, went up to the mirror and straightened her scarf and hair. Looking at her beautiful face, she appeared to become even colder and calmer.





In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.

�Ah! ch&#232;re,� said the countess, �in my life, too, tout n�est pas rose. Don�t I see that, du train que nous allons, our fortune won�t last long! It�s all his club and his kindness. Our life in the country�is that any respite? Theater, hunting, God knows what. Ah, why talk about me! Well, how did you arrange it all? I often marvel at you, Annette, how at your age you can gallop off in a carriage, by yourself, to Moscow, to Petersburg, to all the ministers, to all the nobility, and you know how to deal with them all�I marvel at it! Well, how did it get arranged? I don�t know how to do any of it.�

�Ah, my dear heart!� Princess Anna Mikhailovna replied. �God forbid that you ever learn how hard it is to be left a widow without support and with a son whom you love to distraction. One learns everything,� she went on with a certain pride. �My lawsuit has taught me. If I need to see one of these trumps, I write a note: �Princesse une telle wishes to see so and so��and I go in person, in a hired cab two, even three times, even four�until I get what I want. It�s all the same to me what they think of me.�

�Well, whom did you solicit for Borenka?� asked the countess. �Here your son is an officer in the guards, and Nikolushka is going as a junker. There�s no one to solicit. Who did you ask?�

�Prince Vassily. He was very nice. He agreed at once to do everything and reported to the emperor,� Princess Anna Mikhailovna said with rapture, forgetting entirely about all the humiliation she had gone through to achieve her goal.

�And what, has he aged, Prince Vassily?� asked the countess. �I haven�t seen him since our theater performances at the Rumyantsevs�. And I suppose he�s forgotten me. Il me faisait la cour,� the countess remembered with a smile.

�He�s the same as ever,� replied Anna Mikhailovna, �amiable, overflowing. Les grandeurs ne lui ont pas tourn&#233; la t&#234;te de tout. �I�m sorry I can do so little for you, dear Princess,� he says to me, �I�m yours to command.� No, he�s a nice man, and excellent family. But you know my love for my son, Nathalie. I don�t know what I wouldn�t do for his happiness. And my circumstances are so bad,� Anna Mikhailovna went on sadly, lowering her voice, �so bad that I�m now in a most terrible position. My wretched lawsuit eats up all I have and doesn�t get anywhere. Can you imagine, I don�t have even ten kopecks &#224; la lettre, and I don�t know how I�ll pay to equip Boris.� She took out a handkerchief and began to cry. �I need five hundred roubles, and all I have is one twenty-five-rouble note. I�m in such a position�My only hope now rests with Count Kirill Alexandrovich Bezukhov. If he doesn�t care to support his godson�he�s Borya�s godfather�and lay out something for his maintenance, all my troubles will have been in vain, I won�t have the money to equip him.�

The countess also waxed tearful and silently pondered something.

�I often think�maybe it�s sinful,� said the princess, �but I often think: here Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov lives alone�this enormous fortune�and what does he live for? Life�s a burden to him, and Borya is only beginning to live.�

�He�ll surely leave Boris something,� said the countess.

�God knows, ch&#232;re amie! These rich courtiers are such egoists. But even so I�ll go to him now with Boris and tell him outright what it�s about. Let them think whatever they like of me, it really makes no difference to me, when my son�s destiny depends on it.� The princess got up. �It�s now two o�clock, and you dine at four. I have time to go.�

And with the air of a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make use of her time, Anna Mikhailovna sent for her son and went out with him to the front hall.

�Good-bye, dear heart,� she said to the countess, who came to see her to the door; �wish me success,� she added in a whisper, so that her son would not hear.

�Are you going to see Count Kirill Vladimirovich, ma ch&#232;re?� the count asked from the dining room, also coming out to the front hall. �If he�s better, invite Pierre to dine with us. He used to come here, danced with the children. Invite him without fail, ma ch&#232;re. Well, we�ll see how Taras distinguishes himself today. He says that Count Orlov had no such dinners as we�re going to have.�


XII

�Mon cher Boris,� Princess Anna Mikhailovna said to her son when Countess Rostov�s carriage, in which they were sitting, drove down the straw-laid street and into the wide courtyard of Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov. �Mon cher Boris,� said the mother, freeing her hand from under her old mantle and placing it with a timid and caressing movement on her son�s hand, �be gentle, be attentive. Count Kirill Vladimirovich is, after all, your godfather, and your future fate depends on him. Remember that, mon cher, be nice, as you know how to be��

�If I knew anything would come of it besides humiliation�� her son replied coldly. �But I�ve promised you, and I�m doing it for you.�

Despite the fact that someone�s carriage was standing at the entrance, the porter, having looked over the mother and son (who, without asking to be announced, had walked directly through the glass entryway between two rows of statues in niches), with a significant glance at the old mantle, asked whom they wanted to see, the princesses or the count, and, on learning that it was the count, said that his excellency was feeling worse that day, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.

�We can leave,� the son said in French.

�Mon ami!� the mother said in a pleading voice, again touching her son�s hand as if this touch could calm or encourage him.

Boris fell silent and, without taking off his overcoat, looked questioningly at his mother.

�Dearest,� Anna Mikhailovna said in a tender little voice, turning to the porter, �I know Count Kirill Vladimirovich is very ill�that�s why I�ve come�I�m a relation�I won�t trouble anyone, dearest�All I need is to see Prince Vassily Sergeevich: he is staying here, I believe. Announce us, please.�

The porter sullenly pulled the bell rope that rang upstairs and turned away.

�Princess Drubetskoy to see Prince Vassily Sergeevich,� he called out to the servant in stockings, shoes, and a tailcoat, who had come running down and was now peering from the turn of the stairway.

The mother smoothed the folds of her re-dyed silk dress, looked in a full-length Venetian mirror on the wall, and, in her down-at-heel shoes, went briskly up the carpet of the stairs.

�Mon cher, vous m�avez promis,� she addressed her son again, touching his hand to encourage him.

The son, lowering his eyes, calmly followed after her.

They entered a large room, in which one door led to the apartment assigned to Prince Vassily.

As the mother and son reached the middle of the room, intending to ask their way from an old servant who had jumped up when they came in, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned, and Prince Vassily, in an informal velvet house jacket, with one star, came out, accompanying a handsome dark-haired man. This man was the famous Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.

�C�est donc positif?� the prince was saying.

�Mon prince, �errare humanum est,� mais�� the doctor replied, swallowing his r�s and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.

�C�est bien, c�est bien��

Noticing Anna Mikhailovna and her son, Prince Vassily dismissed the doctor with a bow and silently, but with a questioning look, came over to them. The son noticed how deep grief suddenly appeared in his mother�s eyes and smiled slightly.

�Yes, Prince, we meet here under such sad circumstances�Well, how is our dear patient?� she said, as if oblivious of the cold, insulting gaze directed at her.

Prince Vassily looked questioningly, to the point of bewilderment, at her, then at Boris. Boris bowed courteously. Prince Vassily, without responding to the bow, turned to Anna Mikhailovna and replied to her question with a movement of the head and lips signifying the worst hopes for the patient.

�Can it be?� exclaimed Anna Mikhailovna. �Ah, it�s terrible! I�m afraid to think�This is my son,� she added, pointing to Boris. �He wanted to thank you himself.�

Boris once more bowed courteously.

�Believe me, Prince, a mother�s heart will never forget what you have done for us.�

�I�m glad that I could give you pleasure, my dearest Anna Mikhailovna,� said Prince Vassily, straightening his jabot and in his gesture and voice displaying here, in Moscow, before the patronized Anna Mikhailovna, far greater importance than in Petersburg, at Annette Scherer�s soir&#233;e.

�Try to serve well and be worthy,� he added, sternly addressing Boris. �I�m glad�You�re here on leave?� he dictated in his passionless tone.

�Awaiting orders, Your Excellency, to be dispatched to my new assignment,� replied Boris, showing neither vexation at the prince�s abrupt tone, nor the wish to get into conversation, but so calmly and deferentially that the prince looked at him intently.

�You live with your mother?�

�I live at the countess Rostov�s,� said Boris, again adding, �Your Excellency.�

�It�s that Ilya Rostov who married Nathalie Shinshin,� said Anna Mikhailovna.

�I know, I know,� said Prince Vassily in his monotone voice. �Je n�ai jamais pu concevoir comment Natalie s�est d&#233;cid&#233;e &#224; &#233;pouser cet ours mal-l&#233;ch&#233;! Un personnage compl&#232;tement stupide et ridicule. Et joueur &#224; ce qu�on dit.�

�Mais tr&#232;s brave homme, mon prince,� observed Anna Mikhailovna, smiling touchingly, as though she, too, knew that Count Rostov deserved such an opinion, but begged for pity on the poor old man.

�What do the doctors say?� the princess asked after a brief pause and again showing great sorrow on her weepy face.

�There�s little hope,� said the prince.

�And I wished so much to thank Uncle for all his benefactions to me and to Borya. C�est son filleul,� she added in such a tone, as though this news was to make Prince Vassily extremely glad.

Prince Vassily pondered and winced. Anna Mikhailovna understood that he feared to find in her a rival over Count Bezukhov�s will. She hastened to reassure him.

�If it weren�t for my true love and devotion to Uncle,� she said, uttering this word with special assurance and casualness, �I know his character, noble, direct, but there are just the princesses around him�They�re still young�� She inclined her head and added in a whisper: �Has he fulfilled his last duty, Prince? How precious these last moments are! It cannot get any worse; he must be prepared, if he�s so poorly. We women,� she smiled tenderly, �always know how to say these things, Prince. I must see him. However hard it is for me, by now I�m used to suffering.�

The prince apparently realized, as at Annette Scherer�s soir&#233;e, that it was difficult to get rid of Anna Mikhailovna.

�This meeting might be hard on him, ch&#232;re Anna Mikhailovna,� he said. �Let�s wait till evening; the doctors have predicted a crisis.�

�But we cannot wait, Prince, at such a moment. Pensez, il y va du salut de son &#226;me�Ah! c�est terrible, les devoirs d�un chr&#233;tien��

The door to the inner rooms opened and one of the young princesses�the count�s nieces�came out, with a cold and sullen face and a long waist strikingly out of proportion with her legs.

Prince Vassily turned to her.

�Well, how is he?�

�The same. And, like it or not, this noise�� said the princess, looking Anna Mikhailovna over like a stranger.

�Ah, ch&#232;re, je ne vous reconnaissais pas,� Anna Mikhailovna said with a happy smile, approaching the count�s niece at a light amble. �Je viens d�arriver et je suis &#224; vous pour vous aider &#224; soigner mon oncle. J�imagine combien vous avez souffert,� she added, rolling up her eyes sympathetically.

The princess made no reply, did not even smile, and left at once. Anna Mikhailovna took off her gloves and settled into a hard-won position in an armchair, inviting Prince Vassily to sit down beside her.

�Boris!� she said to her son and smiled. �I�ll go to the count, my uncle, and meanwhile you go to Pierre, mon ami, and don�t forget to convey to him the invitation from the Rostovs. They�re inviting him to dinner. He won�t go, I suppose?� she turned to the prince.

�On the contrary,� said the prince, now plainly out of sorts. �Je serais tr&#232;s content si vous me d&#233;barassez de ce jeune homme� He just sits here. The count has never once asked about him.�

He shrugged his shoulders. The servant led the young man down and up another stairway to Pyotr Kirillovich.

Pierre had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had indeed been banished to Moscow for riotous behavior. The story told at Count Rostov�s was true. Pierre had taken part in tying the policeman to the bear. He had arrived several days ago and was staying, as usual, at his father�s house. Though he supposed that his story was already known in Moscow, and that the ladies who surrounded his father, always ill-disposed towards him, would have used this chance to rile the count, he nevertheless went to his father�s part of the house the day he arrived. On entering the drawing room, where the princesses were usually to be found, he greeted the ladies, who were sitting over their embroidery and a book, which one of them was reading aloud. There were three of them. The eldest, a neat, long-waisted, stern young lady, the one who had come out to Anna Mikhailovna, was reading; the younger ones, both red-cheeked and pretty, differing from each other only in that one had a mole above her lip, which was very becoming to her, were doing embroidery. Pierre was met like a dead man or a leper. The eldest princess interrupted her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes; the younger one, without the mole, assumed exactly the same expression; the youngest, with the mole, of a merry, laughter-prone character, bent over her embroidery frame to hide a smile, probably evoked by the forthcoming scene, which she foresaw would be amusing. She drew the woollen thread through and bent down as if studying the design, barely able to keep from laughing.

�Bonjour, ma cousine,� said Pierre. �Vous ne me reconnaissez pas?�

�I recognize you only too well, only too well.�

�How is the count�s health? May I see him?� Pierre asked awkwardly, as usual, but without embarrassment.

�The count is suffering both physically and morally, and it seems you have taken care to cause him as much moral suffering as possible.�

�May I see the count?� Pierre repeated.

�Hm!�If you want to kill him, to kill him outright, you may see him. Olga, go and see whether uncle�s bouillon is ready, it�s soon time,� she added, thereby showing Pierre that they were busy, and busy comforting his father, while he was obviously only busy upsetting him.

Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters for a while and, bowing, said:

�I�ll go to my room, then. Tell me when I can see him.�

He went out, and the ringing, though not loud, laughter of the sister with the mole could be heard behind him.

The next day Prince Vassily came and settled in the count�s house. He summoned Pierre and said to him:

�Mon cher, si vous vous conduisez ici, comme &#224; P&#233;tersburg, vous finirez tr&#232;s mal; c�est tout ce je vous dis. The count is very, very ill: you must not see him at all.�

Since then Pierre had not been disturbed, and he spent whole days alone upstairs in his room.

When Boris came in, Pierre was pacing his room, stopping now and then in the corners, making threatening gestures to the wall, as if piercing the invisible enemy with a sword, and looking sternly over his spectacles, and then starting his promenade again, uttering vague words, shrugging his shoulders, and spreading his arms.

�L�Angleterre a v&#233;cu,� he said, frowning and pointing his finger at someone. �Monsieur Pitt comme traitre &#224; la nation et au droit des gens est condamn&#233; &#224;�� �he did not have time to finish Pitt�s sentence, imagining at that moment that he was Napoleon himself and with his hero had already carried out the dangerous crossing of the Pas de Calais and conquered London, before he saw a young, trim, and handsome officer come into his room. He stopped. Pierre had left Boris a fourteen-year-old boy and had decidedly no recollection of him; but, despite that, with the quick and cordial manner proper to him, he took his hand and smiled amiably.

�Do you remember me?� Boris said quietly, with a pleasant smile. �I�ve come to see the count with my mother, but it seems he�s not entirely well.�

�Yes, it seems he�s unwell. They keep disturbing him,� Pierre replied, trying to recall who this young man was.

Boris felt that Pierre did not recognize him, but he did not consider it necessary to give his name, and, not feeling the least embarrassed, looked him straight in the eye.

�Count Rostov invites you to dinner today,� he said after a rather long silence, which was awkward for Pierre.

�Ah! Count Rostov!� Pierre began joyfully. �So you�re his son Ilya? Can you imagine, I didn�t recognize you at first. Remember, we used to go to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot�long ago.�

�You are mistaken,� Boris said unhurriedly, with a bold and slightly mocking smile. �I am Boris, the son of Princess Anna Mikhailovna Drubetskoy. The Rostov father is called Ilya, the son is Nikolai. And I never knew any Madame Jacquot.�

Pierre waved his hands and head, as if he was being attacked by mosquitoes or bees.

�Ah, well, how about that! I got everything confused. There are so many relations in Moscow! You�re Boris�yes. So we�ve finally straightened it out. Well, what do you think of the Boulogne expedition? Won�t the English be in trouble if Napoleon crosses the channel? I think the expedition is very important. If only Villeneuve doesn�t botch it!�

Boris knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the newspapers, and was hearing about Villeneuve for the first time.

�Here in Moscow we�re more taken up with dinners and gossip than with politics,� he said in his calm, mocking tone. �I neither know nor think about any of it. Moscow is taken up with gossip most of all,� he went on. �Now the talk is about you and the count.�

Pierre smiled his kindly smile, as if fearing that his interlocutor might say something he would then regret. But Boris spoke distinctly, clearly, drily, looking Pierre straight in the eye.

�Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,� he went on. �Everyone�s concerned about whom the count will leave his fortune to, though maybe he�ll outlive us all, which is my heartfelt wish��

�Yes, it�s all very painful,� Pierre picked up, �very painful.� Pierre kept fearing that this officer would accidentally fall into a conversation awkward for himself.

�And it must seem to you,� Boris said, blushing slightly, but without changing his voice or pose, �it must seem to you that all everyone is concerned with is getting something out of the rich man.�

�Here we go,� thought Pierre.

�But I precisely wish to tell you, so as to avoid misunderstandings, that you are greatly mistaken if you count my mother and me among those people. We�re very poor, but I can speak for myself at least: precisely because your father is rich, I don�t consider myself his relation, and neither I nor my mother will ever ask for or accept anything from him.�

Pierre could not understand for a long time, but when he did, he jumped up from the sofa, seized Boris�s arm from below with his peculiar quickness and awkwardness, and, turning much more red than Boris, began speaking with a mixed feeling of shame and vexation:

�How strange! Did I ever�and who could think�I know very well��

But Boris interrupted him again:

�I�m glad I�ve spoken it all out. Maybe it�s unpleasant for you, you must excuse me,� he said, reassuring Pierre instead of being reassured by him, �but I hope I haven�t offended you. I make it a rule to say everything directly�What shall I tell them, then? Will you come to the Rostovs� for dinner?�

And Boris, obviously relieving himself of a painful duty, getting out of an awkward situation himself, and putting another man in one, again became perfectly pleasant.

�No, listen,� said Pierre, calming down. �You�re a surprising man. What you just said is good, very good. Of course, you don�t know me. We haven�t met for so long�since we were children�You may suppose that I�I understand you, understand you very well. I wouldn�t have done it, I wouldn�t have courage enough, but it�s beautiful. I�m very glad to have made your acquaintance. It�s strange,� he added, after a pause, and smiling, �what you supposed of me!� He laughed. �Well, so what? We�ll become better acquainted. If you please.� He shook Boris�s hand. �You know, I haven�t once been to see the count. He hasn�t sent for me�I pity him as a human being�But what to do?�

�And you think Napoleon will manage to send the army across?� Boris asked, smiling.

Pierre understood that Boris wanted to change the subject, and, agreeing with him, began to explain the advantages and disadvantages of the Boulogne undertaking.

A lackey came to summon Boris to the princess. The princess was leaving. Pierre promised to come for dinner, in order to become closer with Boris, pressed his hand hard, looked him affectionately in the eye through his spectacles�After his departure, Pierre spent a long time pacing the room, no longer piercing the invisible enemy with his sword, but smiling at the memory of this nice, intelligent, and firm young man.

As happens in early youth, and especially when one is alone, he felt a gratuitous tenderness for this young man and promised himself to be sure to become friends with him.

Prince Vassily was seeing the princess off. The princess was holding a handkerchief to her eyes, and her face was all in tears.

�It�s terrible! terrible!� she was saying. �But whatever it costs me, I will fulfill my duty. I will come to spend the night. He can�t be left like that. Every minute is precious. I don�t understand why the princesses keep delaying. Maybe God will help me find the means to prepare him�Adieu, mon prince, que le bon Dieu vous soutienne��

�Adieu, ma bonne,� Prince Vassily replied, turning away from her.

�Ah, he�s in a terrible state,� the mother said to the son, as they were getting back into the carriage. �He hardly recognizes anyone.�

�I don�t understand, mama, what is his attitude towards Pierre?� asked the son.

�It will all be spelled out in the will; our fate, too, depends on it��

�But why do you think he�ll leave us anything?�

�Ah, my friend! He�s so rich, and we�re so poor!�

�Well, that�s still not enough of a reason, Mama.�

�Ah, my God! my God! he�s so ill!� the mother exclaimed.



XIV

When Anna Mikhailovna and her son left for Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov�s, Countess Rostov sat for a long time alone, putting her handkerchief to her eyes. Finally she rang.

�What�s wrong, dear,� she said crossly to the girl, who made her wait a few minutes. �You don�t want to serve me? Then I�ll find another place for you, miss.�

The countess was upset by her friend�s woes and humiliating poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, which always expressed itself in her calling the maid �dear� and �miss.�

�Beg pardon, ma�am,� said the maid.

�Ask the count to come to me.�

The count, waddling, approached his wife with a somewhat guilty look, as he always did.

�Well, my little countess! what a saut&#233; au mad&#232;re of hazel grouse we�ll have, ma ch&#232;re! I sampled it. Not for nothing did I pay a thousand roubles for Taraska. He�s worth it!�

He sat down by his wife, resting his elbows dashingly on his knees and ruffling his gray hair.

�What are your orders, little countess!�

�The thing is, my friend�what�s this stain you�ve got there?� she said, pointing to his waistcoat. �Must be the saut&#233;,� she added, smiling. �The thing is, Count, that I need money.�

Her face grew sad.

�Ah, little countess!�� And the count began fussing, pulling out his wallet.

�I need a lot, Count, I need five hundred rubles.� And, taking out a cambric handkerchief, she began rubbing her husband�s waistcoat.

�Just a moment. Hey, you there!� he cried in a voice such as people use who are sure that those they call will come rushing to them. �Send Mitenka to me!�

Mitenka, that nobleman�s son, brought up by the count, who now managed all his affairs, came into the room with quiet steps.

�The thing is, my dear�� the count said to the deferential young man as he came in. �Bring me�� He pondered. �Yes, yes, seven hundred roubles. And see that you don�t bring torn and dirty ones like the other time, but nice ones, for the countess.�

�Yes, Mitenka, please, be sure they�re clean,� said the countess, sighing sadly.

�When shall I bring it, Your Excellency?� asked Mitenka. �Allow me to tell you that�However, please don�t worry,� he added, noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly, which was always a sign of incipient wrath. �I almost forgot�Shall I deliver it this minute?�

�Yes, yes, right, bring it. Give it to the countess.�

�He�s pure gold, my Mitenka,� the count added, smiling, when the young man went out. �Nothing�s ever impossible. I can�t stand that. Everything�s possible.�

�Ah, money, Count, money�there�s so much grief in the world because of it!� said the countess. �But I need this money very badly.�

�You, my dear countess, are a notorious spendthrift,� said the count, and, kissing his wife�s hand, he went back to his study.

When Anna Mikhailovna came back from Bezukhov�s, the money was already lying before the countess, all in new notes, under a handkerchief on a little table, and Anna Mikhailovna noticed that something was troubling the countess.

�Well, my friend?� asked the countess.

�Ah, he�s in such a terrible state! You wouldn�t recognize him, he�s so poorly, so poorly; I stayed only a minute and didn�t say two words��

�Annette, for God�s sake, don�t refuse me,� the countess said suddenly, blushing, which was quite strange with her thin, dignified, and no longer young face, and taking the money from under the handkerchief.

Anna Mikhailovna instantly realized what it was about and bent forward so as to embrace the countess adroitly at the right moment.

�This is for Boris from me, to have his uniform made��

Anna Mikhailovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess was also weeping. They wept because they were friends; and because they were kind; and because they, who had been friends since childhood, were concerned with such a mean subject�money; and because their youth was gone�But for both of them they were pleasant tears�


XV

Countess Rostov, with her daughters and an already large number of guests, was sitting in the drawing room. The count led the male guests to his study, to offer them his prize collection of Turkish pipes. From time to time he came out and asked whether she had come yet. They were expecting Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimov, known in society as le terrible dragon, a lady famous neither for her wealth nor for her rank, but for her directness of mind and frank simplicity of manners. Marya Dmitrievna was known to the tsar�s family, was known to all Moscow and all Petersburg, and both cities, astonished at her, chuckled secretly at her rudeness and told anecdotes about her; nevertheless, everyone without exception respected and feared her.

In the smoke-filled study the conversation turned to the war, which had been declared in the manifesto, and to recruitment. No one had read the manifesto yet, but everyone knew of its appearance. The count sat on an ottoman between two smoking and talking neighbors. The count himself neither smoked nor talked, but, inclining his head now to one side, now to the other, looked with obvious pleasure at the smokers and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he had set on each other.

One of the talkers was a civilian with a wrinkled, bilious, gaunt, and clean-shaven face, a man approaching old age, though dressed like a most fashionable young man; he sat with his feet on the ottoman, looking like a familiar of the house, the amber bit deep in the side of his mouth, impetuously sucking in smoke and squinting. This was the old bachelor Shinshin, the countess�s cousin, a wicked tongue, as the talk went in Moscow drawing rooms. He seemed to be condescending to his interlocutor. The other, a fresh, pink officer of the guards, impeccably scrubbed, combed, and buttoned-up, held the amber bit in the middle of his mouth and drew the smoke in lightly with his pink lips, letting it out of his handsome mouth in rings. This was that Lieutenant Berg, an officer of the Semyonovsky regiment, with whom Boris was going off to join the regiment, and whom Natasha, teasing Vera, her older sister, called her fianc&#233;. The count sat between them and listened attentively. For the count, the most agreeable occupation, apart from the game of Boston, which he liked very much, was the position of listener, especially when he managed to set two garrulous interlocutors on each other.

�Well, what then, old boy, mon tr&#232;s honorable Alphonse Karlych,� said Shinshin, chuckling and combining (which was a peculiarity of his speech) the simplest popular Russian expressions with refined French phrases. �Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l�&#233;tat, you want to get a little something from your company?�

�No, Pyotr Nikolaevich, I merely wish to prove, sir, that the cavalry is much less profitable than the infantry. Now look, Pyotr Nikolaevich, just consider my position.�

Berg always spoke very precisely, calmly, and courteously. His conversation was always concerned with himself alone; he always kept calmly silent when the talk was about something that had no direct relation to himself. And he could be silent like that for several hours, without experiencing in himself or causing in others the slightest embarrassment. But as soon as the conversation concerned him personally, he began to speak expansively and with obvious pleasure.

�Consider my position, Pyotr Nikolaich: if I were in the cavalry, I�d get no more than two hundred roubles every four months, even with the rank of sublieutenant; while now I get two hundred and thirty,� he said with a joyful, pleasant smile, looking at Shinshin and the count as though it was obvious to him that his success would always constitute the chief goal of everyone else�s desires.

�Besides that, Pyotr Nikolaevich, in transferring to the guards, I am in view,� Berg went on, �and vacancies in the foot guards are much more frequent. Then, consider for yourself how I�m able to get along on two hundred and thirty rubles. Yet I save some and also send some to my father,� he went on, letting out a smoke ring.

�La balance y est�A German can make cheese from chalk, comme dit le proverbe,� said Shinshin, shifting the amber to the other side of his mouth, and he winked at the count.

The count burst out laughing. Other guests, seeing that Shinshin was conducting a conversation, came over to listen. Berg, oblivious of both the mockery and the indifference, went on to tell how he, by being transferred to the guards, was already one rank ahead of his comrades in the corps, how in wartime the company commander might be killed, and he, remaining the senior in the company, could very easily become the commander, and how everyone in the regiment liked him, and how his papa was pleased with him. Berg apparently enjoyed telling about it all and seemed not to suspect that other people might also have their interests. But everything he told about was so nice, so earnest, the na&#239;vet&#233; of his youthful egoism was so obvious, that his listeners were disarmed.

�Well, old boy, infantry or cavalry, you�ll make it anywhere; that I prophesy to you,� said Shinshin, patting him on the shoulder and lowering his feet from the ottoman.

Berg smiled joyfully. The count, and his guests after him, went to the drawing room.

It was that time before a formal dinner when the assembled guests refrain from beginning a long conversation, expecting to be called to the hors d�oeuvres, but at the same time consider it necessary to move about and not be silent, in order to show that they are not at all impatient to sit down at the table. The hosts keep glancing at the door and occasionally exchange glances with each other. The guests try to guess from these glances who or what they are still waiting for: an important belated relation or a dish that is not ready yet.

Pierre arrived just before dinner and sat awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room, in the first armchair he happened upon, getting in everyone�s way. The countess wanted to get him to talk, but he looked around na&#239;vely through his spectacles, as if searching for someone, and gave monosyllabic answers to all the countess�s questions. He was an inconvenience and was the only one not to notice it. The majority of the guests, knowing his story with the bear, looked curiously at this big, fat, and placid man, wondering how such a clumsy and shy fellow could perform such a stunt with a policeman.

�Did you arrive recently?� the countess asked him.

�Oui, madame,� he replied, looking around.

�Have you seen my husband?�

�Non, madame.� He smiled quite inappropriately.

�It seems you were recently in Paris? I suppose it was very interesting.�

�Very interesting.�

The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna understood that she was being asked to take up this young man, and sitting beside him, she began speaking of his father; but, as with the countess, he gave her nothing but monosyllabic answers. The guests were all taken up with each other.

�Les Razoumovsky�&#199;a a &#233;t&#233; charmant�Vous &#234;tes bien bonne�La comtesse Apraksine�� was heard on all sides. The countess got up and went to the reception room.

�Marya Dmitrievna?� her voice was heard from there.

�Herself,� a rough female voice was heard in reply, after which Marya Dmitrievna came into the room.

All the girls and even the ladies, except for the oldest ones, rose. Marya Dmitrievna stood in the doorway and, from the height of her corpulent body, her fifty-year-old head with its gray curled hair held high, looked over the guests, and unhurriedly straightened the wide sleeves of her dress, as if pushing them up. Marya Dmitrievna always spoke in Russian.

�Congratulations to the dear name-day lady and her children,� she said in her loud, dense voice, which overwhelmed all other noises. �And you, you old sinner,� she turned to the count, who was kissing her hand, �I bet you�re bored in Moscow? No chasing about with dogs here? Nothing to be done, old boy, look how these birdies are growing up.� She pointed to the girls. �Like it or not, you�ll have to hunt for suitors.�

�Well, how�s my Cossack?� (Marya Dmitrievna called Natasha a Cossack), she said, caressing Natasha, who came up to kiss her hand fearlessly and merrily. �I know she�s a wicked girl, but I love her.�

She took from her enormous reticule a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings and, having given them to the festively radiant and red-cheeked Natasha, turned away at once and addressed Pierre.

�E-eh! my gallant! come here to me!� she said in a falsely quiet and high voice. �Come here to me, my gallant��

And she menacingly pushed her sleeves up still higher.

Pierre approached, gazing at her na&#239;vely through his spectacles.

�Come on, come on, my gallant! I was the only one to tell your father the truth when chance smiled on him, and to you, too, God willing.�

She paused. Everyone fell silent, waiting for what would happen and feeling that this was only the preface.

�A fine one, to say the least! a fine lad!�His father�s lying on his deathbed, and he�s having fun, sitting a policeman on the back of a bear! Shame on you, old boy, shame on you! You�d do better to go to the war.�

She turned away and offered her arm to the count, who could barely keep from laughing.

�Well, so, I suppose it�s to table?� said Marya Dmitrievna.

The count went first with Marya Dmitrievna; then came the countess, led by a hussar colonel, a useful man, with whom Nikolai was to overtake his regiment, and Anna Mikhailovna with Shinshin. Berg offered his arm to Vera. The smiling Julie Karagin went to the table with Nikolai. After them came other couples, stretching the whole length of the room, and behind them all the children, tutors, and governesses came singly. Servants bustled about, chairs scraped, music began playing in the gallery, and the guests seated themselves. The sounds of the count�s household music were replaced by the sounds of knives and forks, the talk of the guests, the soft footsteps of the servants. At the head of the table on one end sat the countess. To her right Marya Dmitrievna, to her left Anna Mikhailovna and the other ladies. At the other end sat the count, to his left the hussar colonel, to his right Shinshin and the other male guests. One side of the long table was occupied by the older young people: Vera sat next to Berg, Pierre next to Boris; on the other side were the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind the crystal, the bottles, and the bowls of fruit, the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with blue ribbons, and diligently poured wine for his neighbors, not forgetting himself. The countess, too, from behind the pineapples, never forgetting her duties as hostess, cast meaningful glances at her husband, the redness of whose face and bald head, it seemed to her, contrasted sharply with his gray hair. At the ladies� end a steady chatter went on; at the men�s, louder and louder voices could be heard, especially that of the hussar colonel, who ate and drank so much, growing redder and redder, that the count now set him as an example to the other guests. Berg was saying to Vera, with a tender smile, that love was a heavenly, not an earthly, feeling. Boris was naming the guests at the table for his new friend Pierre, while exchanging glances with Natasha, who was sitting across from him. Pierre spoke little, looked at the new faces, and ate a lot. Starting with the two soups, of which he chose &#224; la tortue, and the savory pie, and right up to the hazel grouse, he did not skip a single dish or a single wine, which the butler mysteriously displayed for him behind his neighbor�s shoulder, the bottle wrapped in a napkin, murmuring: �dry Madeira,� or �Hungarian,� or �Rhine wine.� Of the four crystal glasses with the count�s monogram that stood before each place, he would hold out the first he happened upon and drank with enjoyment, glancing around at the guests with a more and more pleasant air. Natasha, who was sitting across from him, gazed at Boris as a thirteen-year-old girl gazes at a boy she has just kissed for the first time and is in love with. She occasionally turned this same gaze to Pierre, and, under the gaze of this funny, lively girl, he wanted to laugh himself, without knowing why.

Nikolai sat far away from Sonya, next to Julie Karagin, and again was saying something to her with an involuntary smile. Sonya smiled formally, but was clearly suffering from jealousy: she turned pale, then red, and tried as hard as she could to hear what Nikolai and Julie were saying to each other. The governess looked around anxiously, as if preparing to resist, if anyone took it into his head to offend the children. The German tutor tried to memorize all the kinds of dishes, desserts, and wines, in order to describe everything in detail in his letter to his family in Germany, and was quite offended that the butler with the napkin-wrapped bottle bypassed him. The German frowned, trying to show by his look that he did not even wish to have this wine, but was offended because no one wanted to understand that the wine was necessary for him, not in order to quench his thirst, nor out of greed, but out of a conscientious love of knowledge.


XVI

At the men�s end of the table, the conversation was becoming more and more animated. The colonel said that the manifesto with the declaration of war had already been published in Petersburg, and that a copy, which he had seen himself, had been delivered today by messenger to the commander in chief.

�And what the deuce makes us go to war with Bonaparte?� said Shinshin. �Il a d&#233;j&#224; rabattu le caquet &#224; l�Autriche. Je crains que cette fois ce ne soit notre tour.�

The colonel was a tall, stout, and sanguine German, obviously a seasoned soldier and a patriot. He took offense at Shinshin�s words.

�Pecause, my tear sir,� he said, pronouncing the b as a p and the d as a t, �pecause the emperor knows that. He said in the manifesto that he cannot look mit intifference at the tangers that threaten Russia, and that the security of the empire, its tignity, and the sacretness of its alliances�� he said, for some reason giving special emphasis to the word alliances, as if this was the essence of the matter.

And with that impeccable official memory peculiar to him, he repeated the introductory words of the manifesto: ��and the desire, which constitutes the sole and absolute aim of the sovereign, to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations, led to his present decision to move part of the army abroad and to make further efforts towards the achievement of that intention.�

�It�s pecause of that, my tear sir,� he concluded didactically, drinking a glass of wine and looking to the count for encouragement.

�Connaissez-vous le proverbe: �Jerome, Jerome, stay close to home, keep your shovel in the loam�?� asked Shinshin, wincing and smiling. �Cela nous convient &#224; merveille. Take Suvorov�even he got beaten &#224; plate couture, and where are our Suvorovs now? Je vous demande un peu,� he said, constantly switching from Russian to French.

�Ve must fight to the last trop of plood,� said the colonel, pounding the table, �und ti-i-ie for our emperor, and then all vill be vell. And reason as little as po-o-ossible� (he especially drew out the word possible), �as little as po-o-ossible,� he concluded, again addressing the count. �So ve old hussars see it, anyvay. And how to you, a young man and a young hussar, see it?� he added, turning to Nikolai, who, hearing that things had got on to the war, had abandoned his interlocutrice and was looking all eyes and listening all ears to the colonel.

�I agree with you completely,� replied Nikolai, blushing all over, turning his plate and rearranging the glasses, and with such a determined and desperate air as though he was exposed right then to great danger. �I�m convinced that the Russians must either die or conquer,� he said, aware himself, as the others were, once the word had been spoken, that it was too rapturous and pompous for the present occasion and therefore awkward.

�C�est bien beau ce que vous venez de dire,� Julie, who was sitting next to him, said with a sigh. Sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears, behind her ears, and down her neck and shoulders, as Nikolai was speaking. Pierre listened to what the colonel said and nodded approvingly.

�That�s very nice,� he said.

�A real hussar, young man,� cried the colonel, pounding the table again.

�What�s this noise about?� Marya Dmitrievna�s bass voice was suddenly heard all down the table. �What are you pounding the table for?� she addressed the hussar. �Why are you getting excited? Maybe you think the French are here in front of you?�

�I�m speakink the truth,� the hussar said, smiling.

�It�s all about the war,� the count shouted down the table. �My son�s going, Marya Dmitrievna, my son.�

�I�ve got four sons in the army, and I�m not grieving. It�s all God�s will: you can die in your sleep, and God can spare you in battle,� the dense voice of Marya Dmitrievna rang out effortlessly from the other end of the table.

�That�s so.�

And the conversation again became concentrated, the ladies� at their end of the table, the men�s at theirs.

�You don�t dare ask,� said Natasha�s little brother, �you don�t dare ask!�

�Yes, I do,� replied Natasha.

Her face suddenly flushed, expressing a desperate and merry resolve. She stood up, her eyes inviting Pierre, who sat across from her, to listen, and addressed her mother.

�Mama!� her throaty child�s voice rang out for the whole table to hear.

�What is it?� the countess asked fearfully, but, seeing from her daughter�s face that it was a prank, she sternly waved her hand at her, making a threatening and negative gesture with her head.

The conversation hushed.

�Mama! what�s for dessert?� Natasha�s little voice rang out still more resolutely, without faltering.

The countess wanted to frown, but could not. Marya Dmitrievna shook her fat finger.

�Cossack!� she said menacingly.

Most of the guests looked at the parents, not knowing how to take this escapade.

�You�re going to get it!� said the countess.

�Mama! what�s for dessert?� cried Natasha, boldly now and with capricious merriment, certain beforehand that her escapade would be taken well.

Sonya and fat Petya hid their faces with laughter.

�So I dared,� Natasha whispered to her little brother and to Pierre, at whom she glanced again.

�Ice cream, only you won�t get any,� said Marya Dmitrievna.

Natasha saw there was nothing to fear, so she was not afraid of Marya Dmitrievna either.

�What kind of ice cream, Marya Dmitrievna? I don�t like vanilla.�

�Carrot.�

�No, what kind, Marya Dmitrievna, what kind?� she nearly shouted. �I want to know!�

Marya Dmitrievna and the countess laughed, and all the guests followed suit. Everyone laughed not at Marya Dmitrievna�s reply, but at the inconceivable boldness and adroitness of this girl, who was both smart and pert enough to treat Marya Dmitrievna that way.

Natasha left off only when they told her there would be pineapple ice cream. Before the ice cream, champagne was served. The music struck up again, the count kissed his dear countess, and the guests, rising, wished the countess a happy name day, and clinked glasses across the table with the count, the children, and each other. Again the waiters scurried about, chairs scraped, and the guests, in the same order but with redder faces, returned to the drawing room and the count�s study.


XVII

Tables were set up for Boston, parties were chosen, and the count�s guests settled themselves in the two drawing rooms, the sitting room, and the library.

The count, his cards spread in a fan, refrained with difficulty from his usual after-dinner nap and laughed at everything. The young people, at the countess�s urging, gathered around the clavichord and the harp. Julie was the first, at everybody�s request, to play a piece with variations for the harp, and, along with the other girls, began asking Natasha and Nikolai, known for their musicality, to sing something. Natasha, who was addressed like a grown-up, was obviously very proud of it, but at the same time timid.

�What shall we sing?� she asked.

��The Spring,�� replied Nikolai.

�Well, let�s be quick about it. Boris, come here,� said Natasha. �But where�s Sonya?�

She looked around and, seeing that her friend was not in the room, ran to look for her.

Running into Sonya�s room and not finding her friend there, Natasha ran to the nursery�Sonya was not there either. Natasha realized that Sonya was in the corridor on the chest. The chest in the corridor was the place of sorrows for the young female generation of the Rostov house. Indeed, Sonya, in her airy pink dress, crushing it, was lying face down on the nanny�s dirty striped featherbed, on the chest, and, covering her face with her fingers, was sobbing, her bare little shoulders twitching. Natasha�s face, animated and festive all day, suddenly changed: her eyes stared, then her broad neck shuddered, and the corners of her mouth drooped.

�Sonya! what is it?�What, what�s the matter with you? Wa-a-a!��

And Natasha, spreading her big mouth and looking perfectly ugly, started howling like a baby, not knowing the reason why, only because Sonya was crying. Sonya wanted to raise her head and reply, but could not and buried herself still more. Natasha wept, sitting on the blue featherbed and embracing her friend. Gathering her forces, Sonya sat up and began wiping away her tears and telling her story.

�Nikolenka�s leaving in a week, his�papers�are ready�he told me himself�But all the same I wouldn�t be crying� (she held up the paper she had in her hand: it was verses written by Nikolai) ��all the same I wouldn�t be crying, but you can�t�nobody can understand�what a soul he has.�

And again she began to cry, because his soul was so good.

�It�s all right for you�I�m not envious�I love you, and Boris, too,� she said, gathering her forces a little, �he�s nice�there are no obstacles for you. But Nikolai�s my cousin�we need�the metropolitan himself�even then it�s impossible. And then, if mama� (Sonya considered and called the countess her mother) ��she�ll say that I�m ruining Nikolai�s career, that I have no heart, that I�m ungrateful, and really�I swear to God� (she crossed herself) ��I love her and all of you so much, only Vera�Why? What have I done to her? I�m so grateful to you that I�d be glad to sacrifice everything I have, but I don�t have anything��

Sonya could not speak any more and again hid her head in her hands and in the featherbed. Natasha began to calm down, but it was clear from her face that she realized all the importance of her friend�s grief.

�Sonya!� she said suddenly, as if guessing the real reason for her cousin�s distress. �Vera must have talked with you after dinner? Did she?�

�Yes, Nikolai himself wrote out these verses, and I wrote down some others; she found them on my desk and said she�d show them to mama, and she also said I was ungrateful, that mama would never let him marry me, and that he�d marry Julie. You see how he�s been with her the whole day�Natasha! Why?��

And again she burst out crying more bitterly than before. Natasha pulled her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began to reassure her.

�Sonya, don�t believe her, dear heart, don�t believe her. Remember how we and Nikolenka, the three of us, talked in the sitting room�remember, after supper? We decided how everything was going to be. I don�t remember how anymore, but remember how good and possible it all was? Why, Uncle Shinshin�s brother married his first cousin, and we�re just second cousins. And Boris said it was very possible. You know, I told him everything. And he�s so intelligent and so nice,� Natasha went on saying ��so don�t cry, Sonya, dearest, darling Sonya.� And she kissed her, laughing. �Vera�s wicked, God help her! But everything will be all right, and she won�t tell mama; Nikolenka will tell her himself, and he never gave a thought to Julie.�

And she kissed her on the head. Sonya got up, the kitten revived, its eyes sparkled, and it seemed ready to raise its tail any moment, spring up on its soft paws, and play with a ball of yarn, as a kitten ought to do.

�Do you think so? Really? Swear to God?� she said, quickly straightening her dress and hair.

�Really! Swear to God!� replied Natasha, straightening a strand of stiff hair that had come loose from her friend�s braid.

And the two girls laughed.

�So, let�s go and sing �The Spring.��

�Yes, let�s.�

�You know, that fat Pierre, who sat across from me, is so funny!� Natasha said suddenly, stopping. �I feel so merry!�

And Natasha went running down the corridor.

Sonya, brushing off feathers, and hiding the verses in her bosom, near her neck with its protruding collarbones, her face flushed, went running after Natasha with light, merry steps down the corridor to the sitting room. At the request of the guests, the young people sang the quartet �The Spring,� which everyone liked very much. Then Nikolai sang a song he had just learned:


On a pleasant night beneath the moon

How happy is the reverie

That in this world there still is one

Whose thoughts do ever turn to thee!

And as her lovely hand, which she

Lets wander o�er the harp�s bright strings,

Plays in impassioned harmony,

So she to thee her summons sings!

One day, two days, then paradise�

But ah! thy friend is cold as ice!


And he had not finished singing the last words before the young people in the ballroom began preparing to dance, and the musicians began stamping their feet and coughing in the gallery.

Pierre was sitting in the drawing room, where Shinshin, knowing he had come from abroad, had started a boring political conversation with him, in which other people joined. When the music began to play, Natasha came into the drawing room and, going straight up to Pierre, blushing and with laughing eyes, said:

�Mama told me to ask you to dance.�

�I�m afraid I�ll confuse the figures,� said Pierre, �but if you�d like to be my teacher��

And, lowering his fat arm, he offered it to the slender girl.

While the couples were being placed and the musicians were tuning up, Pierre sat with his little partner. Natasha was perfectly happy: she was dancing with a grown-up who had come from abroad. She sat in full view of everyone and talked to him like a grown-up. In her hand was a fan which a young lady had given her to hold. And, assuming a most worldly pose (God knows where and when she had learned it), fanning herself and smiling through the fan, she talked with her partner.

�Look at her! Just look at her!� said the old countess, walking through the room and pointing at Natasha.

Natasha blushed and laughed.

�Well, what is it, mama? What are you getting at? What�s so surprising?�

In the middle of the third &#233;cossaise, chairs began moving in the drawing room where the count and Marya Dmitrievna were playing, and the greater part of the honored guests and old folk, stretching after sitting so long and putting their wallets and purses in their pockets, came to the door of the ballroom. At their head came Marya Dmitrievna and the count�both with merry faces. The count, with jocular politeness, somehow in a ballet-like fashion, offered his rounded arm to Marya Dmitrievna. He drew himself up and his face brightened with a special dashingly sly smile, and as soon as the last figures of the &#233;cossaise came to an end, he clapped his hands and called out to the musicians in the gallery, addressing the first fiddle:

�Semyon! Do you know �Daniel Cooper�?�

That was the count�s favorite dance, which he used to dance while still in his youth. (�Daniel Cooper� was in fact one of the figures of the anglaise.)

�Look at papa,� Natasha shouted to the whole ballroom (completely forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up), bending her curly head to her knees and dissolving into her ringing laughter for the whole ballroom to hear.

Indeed, all who were in the ballroom looked with smiles of joy at the merry old man, who, beside his stately partner, Marya Dmitrievna, who was taller than he, rounded his arms, shook them in time to the music, squared his shoulders, flexed his legs, stamped slightly, and, the smile widening more and more on his round face, prepared the spectators for what was to come. As soon as the merry, provocative sounds of �Daniel Cooper,� resembling a rollicking trepak, rang out, all the doors of the ballroom suddenly filled with the smiling faces of the servants�the men on one side, the women on the other�who came to watch their master�s merrymaking.

�Look at the old dear! An eagle!� the nanny said loudly from one door.

The count danced well and knew it, but his partner could not and would not dance well at all. Her enormous body stood straight, her powerful arms hung down (she had given her reticule to the countess); only her stern but handsome face danced. What was expressed in the whole round figure of the count, in Marya Dmitrievna was expressed in her ever more smiling face and ever more thrust-up nose. On the other hand, if the count, who got himself going more and more, fascinated his spectators by his unexpectedly deft capers and the light leaps of his supple legs, Marya Dmitrievna, by the slightest exertion in moving her shoulders or rounding her arms while turning or stamping, produced no less of an impression by its merit, which everyone appreciated in view of her corpulence and perpetual severity. The dance became more and more lively. The other couples could not draw attention to themselves for a minute and did not even try to. All were taken up with the count and Marya Dmitrievna. Natasha pulled everyone present by the sleeve or the dress, demanding that they look at papa, though even without that they never took their eyes off the dancers. The count, during the pauses in the dance, panted heavily, waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster. More and more quickly, more and more dashingly the count deployed himself, now on tiptoe, now on his heels, racing around Marya Dmitrievna, and finally, returning his partner to her seat, he performed the last step, raising his supple leg behind him, bending down his sweating head with its smiling face, and waving his rounded right arm amidst the thunder of applause and laughter, especially from Natasha. The two dancers stopped, breathing heavily and wiping their faces with cambric handkerchiefs.

�That�s how people danced in our time, ma ch&#232;re,� said the count.

�Ah, what a Daniel Cooper!� said Marya Dmitrievna, letting out a long, deep breath and pushing up her sleeves.


XVIII

Just as the sixth anglaise was being danced in the Rostovs� ballroom to the sounds of the weary, out-of-tune musicians and the weary servants and cooks were preparing supper, Count Bezukhov had his sixth stroke. The doctors declared that there was no hope of recovery; the sick man was given a blank confession and communion; preparations for extreme unction were made, and the house was filled with the bustle and anxiety of expectation usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond the gate, avoiding the carriages that drove up, undertakers crowded in anticipation of a rich order for the count�s funeral. The commander in chief of Moscow, who had constantly been sending adjutants to ask after the count�s health, came in person that evening to take leave of Catherine�s celebrated courtier, Count Bezukhov.

The magnificent reception room was filled. Everyone rose deferentially when the commander in chief, having spent about half an hour alone with the sick man, came out, responding slightly to the bows and trying to go quickly past the looks that doctors, clergymen, and relations directed at him. Prince Vassily, grown thin and pale during those days, accompanied the commander in chief and quietly repeated something to him several times.

Having seen the commander in chief off, Prince Vassily sat by himself on a chair in the hall, his legs crossed high up, his elbow resting on his knee, his hand over his eyes. Having sat like that for some time, he got up and, with unhabitually hurried steps, looking around with frightened eyes, went down the long corridor to the rear half of the house, to the eldest princess.

Those who were in the dimly lit room talked together in broken whispers, and fell silent each time, turning with eyes full of inquiry and expectation to the door which led to the dying man�s room and which made a faint noise whenever someone went in or came out.

�A limit has been set,� said a little old man, a clerical person, to a lady who sat down beside him and listened to him na&#239;vely, �a limit has been set to human life, which cannot be overstepped.�

�I wonder if it�s not too late to give extreme unction?� the lady asked, adding his clerical title, as if she had no opinion on the subject.

�It is a great sacrament, my dear,� the clerical person replied, passing his hand over his bald head, which had several strands of half-gray hair combed over it.

�Who was that? The commander in chief himself?� someone asked at the other end of the room. �What a youthful man!��

�He�s in his sixties! Well, so they say the count no longer recognizes anyone? Do they mean to give him extreme unction?�

�I knew a man who received extreme unction seven times.�

The second princess came out of the sick man�s room with tearful eyes and sat down next to Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a table.

�Tr&#232;s beau,� the doctor said in reply to a question about the weather, �tr&#232;s beau, princesse, et puis, &#224; Moscou on se croit &#224; la campagne.�

�N�est-ce-pas?� said the princess, sighing. �So he�s allowed to drink?�

Lorrain pondered.

�Has he taken his medicine?�

�Yes.�

The doctor looked at his Breguet.

�Take a glass of boiled water and put in une pinc&#233;e� (with his slender fingers he showed what une pinc&#233;e meant) �de cremortartari��

�Dere hass been no occasion,� a German doctor said to an adjutant, �dat one remains alife after a second shtroke.�

�And he was such a fresh man!� said the adjutant. �And to whom will all that wealth go?� he added in a whisper.

�Dere vill be no lack of seekers,� the German said, smiling.

Everyone looked at the door again: it creaked, and the second princess, having prepared the drink prescribed by Lorrain, carried it to the sick man. The German doctor went over to Lorrain.

�He may still last until tomorrow morning?� the German asked in poorly pronounced French.

Lorrain, compressing his lips, wagged his finger sternly and negatively in front of his nose.

�Tonight, no later,� he said softly, with a decent smile of self-satisfaction at being able to clearly understand and explain the patient�s condition, and walked away.

Meanwhile, Prince Vassily had opened the door to the princess�s room.

The room was in semi-darkness, only two icon lamps burned before the icons, and there was a good smell of incense and flowers. The whole room was filled with small furniture: little chiffoniers, cupboards, tables. Behind a screen the white covers of a high featherbed could be seen. A little dog barked.

�Ah, it�s you, mon cousin?�

She got up and straightened her hair, which was always, even now, so extraordinarily smooth that it seemed varnished and of one piece with her head.

�What, has something happened?� she asked. �I�m so frightened.�

�Nothing, it�s all the same; I have only come to have a talk with you, Catiche, about business,� said the prince, sitting with an air of fatigue in the armchair from which she had gotten up. �How warm you keep it, though,� he said. �Well, sit down here, causons.�

�I thought something had happened,� said the princess, and with her unchanging, stern and stony expression, she sat down opposite the prince and prepared to listen.

�I wanted to get some sleep, mon cousin, but I can�t.�

�Well, and so, my dear?� said Prince Vassily, taking the princess�s hand and pulling it down, as was his habit.

It was clear that this �and so� referred to many things they both understood without naming them.

The princess, with her dry and straight waist, incongruously long for her legs, looked straight and passionlessly at the prince with her prominent gray eyes. She shook her head and, sighing, turned to look at the icons. Her gesture could have been interpreted either as an expression of sorrow and devotion, or as an expression of weariness and hope for a speedy repose. Prince Vassily interpreted this gesture as an expression of weariness.

�And do you think it�s any easier for me?� he said. �Je suis &#233;reint&#233; comme un cheval de poste; but all the same I must talk with you, Catiche, and very seriously.�

Prince Vassily fell silent, and his cheeks began to twitch nervously now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression which never appeared on Prince Vassily�s face when he was in a drawing room. His eyes were also not the same as usual: now they looked with insolent jocularity, now they glanced around fearfully.

The princess, holding the dog on her lap with her dry, thin hands, looked attentively into Prince Vassily�s eyes; but it was evident that she would not break the silence with a question, even if she had to remain silent till morning.

�So you see, my dear princess and cousin, Katerina Semyonovna,� Prince Vassily continued, evidently getting himself to continue his talk only after an inner struggle, �at moments like this, it is necessary to think of everything. It is necessary to think of the future, of you�I love you all like my own children, you know that.�

The princess went on looking at him just as dully and fixedly.

�Finally, it is necessary to think of my family, too,� Prince Vassily continued, angrily pushing a little table away and without looking at her. �You know, Catiche, that you three Mamontov sisters, and my wife as well�we are the count�s only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it is for you to speak and think about such things. It�s no easier for me; but I�m over fifty, my friend, I must be ready for anything. Do you know that I have sent for Pierre, and that the count, pointing directly at his portrait, demanded that he come?�

Prince Vassily looked questioningly at the princess, but could not tell whether she was considering what he had said to her, or was simply staring at him�

�There�s one thing for which I never cease praying to God, mon cousin,� she replied, �that He have mercy on him and grant that his beautiful soul peacefully depart this��

�Yes, that�s right,� Prince Vassily went on impatiently, rubbing his bald head and angrily seizing the little table he had pushed away and moving it towards him again, �but, finally�finally, the thing is, as you know yourself, that last winter the count wrote a will according to which, passing over his direct heirs and us, he bequeathed all his property to Pierre.�

�He has written all sorts of wills,� the princess said calmly, �but he cannot bequeath anything to Pierre! Pierre is illegitimate.�

�But, ma ch&#232;re,� Prince Vassily said suddenly, clutching the little table to him, becoming animated, and beginning to speak more quickly, �what if a letter had been written to the sovereign and the count had asked to adopt Pierre? You understand, given the count�s merits, his request would be granted��

The princess smiled as people smile who think they know more about a matter than those they are talking with.

�I�ll tell you more,� Prince Vassily went on, gripping her hand. �The letter has been written, though not sent, and the sovereign knows of it. The only question is whether it has been destroyed or not. If not, then as soon as it�s all over,� Prince Vassily sighed, letting it be understood what he meant by the words all over, �and the count�s papers are opened, the will and the letter will be sent to the sovereign, and his request will most likely be granted. As a legitimate son, Pierre will get everything.�

�And our share?� asked the princess, smiling ironically, as if anything but that could happen.

�Mais, ma pauvre Catiche, c�est clair comme le jour. He alone is then the legitimate heir to everything, and you won�t get even this much. You must know, my dear, whether the will and the letter were written, and whether they have been destroyed. And if they�ve been overlooked for some reason, you must know where they are and must find them, because��

�That�s all we need!� the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and without changing the expression of her eyes. �I�m a woman; in your opinion, we�re all stupid; but I know enough to be sure that an illegitimate son cannot inherit�Un b&#226;tard,� she added, supposing that this translation would definitively prove to the prince his groundlessness.

�How is it you don�t understand, finally, Catiche? You�re so intelligent, how is it you don�t understand: if the count wrote a letter to the sovereign, in which he asked that his son be recognized as legitimate, it means that Pierre will no longer be Pierre, but Count Bezukhov, and then according to the will he�ll get everything. And if the will and the letter have not been destroyed, there will be nothing left for you except the consolation that you have been virtuous et tout ce qui s�en suit. That is certain.�

�I know that the will has been written; but I also know that it is not valid, and you seem to consider me a perfect fool, mon cousin,� said the princess, with that expression with which women speak when they suppose they have said something witty and insulting.

�My dear Princess Katerina Semyonovna!� Prince Vassily began speaking impatiently. �I have come to you not in order to exchange barbs, but in order to talk with you, as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true kinswoman, about your own interests. I tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the sovereign and the will favoring Pierre are among the count�s papers, then, my darling, you and your sisters do not inherit. If you don�t believe me, believe people who know: I�ve just spoken with Dmitri Onufrich� (this was the family lawyer), �and he says the same thing.�

Evidently something suddenly changed in the princess�s mind; her thin lips turned pale (her eyes remained the same), and her voice, when she began to speak, kept breaking into such tremors as she evidently did not expect herself.

�That would be just fine,� she said. �I don�t want anything and never did.�

She threw the dog off her lap and straightened the folds of her dress.

�There�s gratitude, there�s thankfulness to people who have sacrificed everything for him,� she said. �Wonderful! Very fine! I need nothing, Prince.�

�Yes, but you�re not alone, you have sisters,� replied Prince Vassily.

But the princess was not listening to him.

�Yes, I�ve long known, but I had forgotten, that apart from baseness, deceit, envy, intrigue, apart from ingratitude, the blackest ingratitude, I could expect nothing in this house��

�Do you or do you not know where the will is?� Prince Vassily asked, his cheeks twitching still more than before.

�Yes, I was stupid, I still believed in people, and loved them, and sacrificed myself. But only those who are mean and vile succeed. I know whose intrigue this is.�

The princess was about to get up, but the prince held her by the arm. The princess had the air of someone who has suddenly become disappointed in the whole human race; she looked spitefully at her interlocutor.

�There�s still time, my friend. Remember, Catiche, it was all done inadvertently, in a moment of wrath, illness, and then forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to correct his mistake, to alleviate his last moments by not allowing him to do this injustice, by not letting him die thinking he has made unhappy those people who��

�Those people who sacrificed everything for him,� the princess picked up, again trying to rise, but the prince did not let her, �something he was never able to appreciate. No, mon cousin,� she added with a sigh, �I shall remember that one can expect no reward in this world, that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. One must be cunning and wicked in this world.�

�Well, voyons, calm down; I know your excellent heart.�

�No, I have a wicked heart.�

�I know your heart,� the prince repeated, �I value your friendship, and I wish you were of the same opinion about me. Calm down and parlons raison, while there�s time�maybe a day, maybe an hour. Tell me all you know about the will, and above all, where it is: you must know. We�ll take it right now and show it to the count. He has surely forgotten about it by now and will want it destroyed. You understand that my only desire is to fulfill his wishes religiously; that is the only reason I�ve come here. I am here only to help him and you.�

�Now I�ve understood everything. I know whose intrigue it is. I know,� said the princess.

�That�s not the point, dear heart.�

�It�s your prot&#233;g&#233;e, your dear Anna Mikhailovna, whom I wouldn�t have as a housemaid�that vile, loathsome woman.�

�Ne perdons point de temps.�

�Ah, don�t speak to me! Last winter she wormed her way in here and told the count a whole heap of such vile, such nasty things about us all, especially Sophie�I can�t repeat it�that the count became ill and didn�t want to see us for two weeks. I know it was then that he wrote that nasty, loathsome document; but I thought the document meant nothing.�

�Nous y voil&#224;, why didn�t you tell me anything before?�

�It�s in the inlaid portfolio he keeps under his pillow. Now I know,� said the princess, not replying. �Yes, if I have a sin, a great sin, it�s my hatred of that loathsome woman,� the princess nearly shouted, changing into a competely different person. �And why is she worming her way in here? But I�ll have it out with her, I�ll have it all out. The time will come!�


XIX

While such conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess�s apartments, the carriage bringing Pierre (who had been sent for) and Anna Mikhailovna (who found it necessary to go with him) was driving into Count Bezukhov�s courtyard. As the wheels of the carriage rumbled softly over the straw spread under the windows, Anna Mikhailovna, turning to her companion with words of comfort, discovered that he was asleep in the corner of the carriage, and woke him up. Coming to his senses, Pierre followed Anna Mikhailovna out of the carriage and only then thought about the meeting with his dying father that lay ahead of him. He noticed that they had driven up not to the front, but to the back entrance. Just as he was stepping out, two men in tradesman�s clothes hastily ran away from the entrance into the shadow of the wall. Having stopped, Pierre made out several more men of the same sort in the shadow of the house on both sides. But neither Anna Mikhailovna, nor the footman, nor the coachman, who could not help seeing these men, paid any attention to them. So that is how it has to be, Pierre decided to himself and went after Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna went up the dimly lit, narrow stone stairs with hasty steps, calling to Pierre, who lagged behind her, and who, though he did not understand why in general he had to go to the count, and still less why he had to go by the back stairs, decided to himself, judging by Anna Mikhailovna�s assurance and haste, that this had necessarily to be so. Halfway up the stairs, they were nearly knocked off their feet by some people with buckets who came running down the stairs, stamping with their boots. These people pressed themselves to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikhailovna pass and did not show the least surprise when they saw them.

�Is this the way to the princesses� apartments?� Anna Mikhailovna asked one of them.

�Yes,� the lackey answered in a bold, loud voice, as though everything was permitted now, �the door on the left, good lady.�

�Maybe the count didn�t send for me,� said Pierre, when he came to the landing. �I�ll just go to my own rooms.�

Anna Mikhailovna stopped so that Pierre could catch up with her.

�Ah, mon ami!� she said, with the same gesture as in the morning, when she touched her son�s arm, �croyez que je souffre autant que vous, mais soyez homme.�

�Really, why don�t I go?� asked Pierre, looking at Anna Mikhailovna affectionately through his spectacles.

�Ah, mon ami, oubliez les torts qu�on a pu avoir envers vous, pensez que c�est votre p&#232;re�peut-&#234;tre &#224; l�agonie.� She sighed. �Je vous ai tout de suite aim&#233; comme mon fils. Fiez &#224; moi, Pierre. Je n�oublierais pas vos int&#233;r&#234;ts.�

Pierre understood none of it; he had a still stronger impression that this was how it had to be, and he obediently followed Anna Mikhailovna, who was already opening the door.

The door led to the backstairs hallway. In the corner sat the princesses� old servant knitting a sock. Pierre had never been in this part of the house; he had not even suspected the existence of these rooms. Anna Mikhailovna asked a girl who walked past them with a carafe on a tray (calling her dear and sweetheart) about the princesses� health, and drew Pierre further down the stone corridor. The first room to the left from the corridor led to the princesses� living quarters. The maid with the carafe, in her haste (everything was being done in haste just then in this house), did not close the door, and as they were passing by, Pierre and Anna Mikhailovna involuntarily glanced into the room where the eldest princess and Prince Vassily were sitting close together, talking. Seeing them pass by, Prince Vassily made an impatient movement and drew back; the princess jumped up and, in a desperate gesture, slammed the door shut with all her might.

This gesture was so unlike the princess�s usual calm, the fear that showed on Prince Vassily�s face was so inconsistent with his augustness, that Pierre stopped and looked at his guide questioningly through his spectacles. Anna Mikhailovna expressed no surprise, she only smiled slightly and sighed, as if to show that she had expected it all.

�Soyez homme, mon ami, c�est moi qui veillerai &#224; vos int&#233;r&#234;ts,� she said in response to his look and went still more quickly down the corridor.

Pierre did not understand what it was all about, and still less what veiller &#224; vos int&#233;r&#234;ts meant, but he understood that it all had to be so. From the corridor they went into the half-lit salon adjoining the count�s anteroom. It was one of those cold and luxurious rooms which Pierre knew only from the front porch. But in this room, too, in the middle of it, stood an empty tub, and water had been spilled on the carpet. They encountered a servant and an acolyte with a censer, who were walking on tiptoe and paid no attention to them. They went into the anteroom, so familiar to Pierre, with its two Italian windows opening on the winter garden, a big bust, and a full-length portrait of Catherine. The same people, in almost the same positions, were sitting in the anteroom, exchanging whispers. They all fell silent and turned to look at the entering Anna Mikhailovna, with her pale, weepy face, and the big, fat Pierre, who, with his head hanging, obediently followed her.

Anna Mikhailovna�s face expressed an awareness that the decisive moment had come; with the manner of a business-like Petersburg lady, she entered the room still more boldly than in the morning, not letting Pierre stray from her. She felt that, since she was bringing with her the person whom the dying man wished to see, her reception was assured. With a quick glance around, taking in everyone who was in the room and noticing the count�s father confessor, not really bending down, but suddenly making herself smaller, at a quick amble, glided over to the father confessor and respectfully received a blessing first from the one, then from the other clerical person.

�Thank God we�re in time,� she said to the clerical person. �We, his relations, were all so afraid. This young man is the count�s son,� she added in a lower voice. �A terrible moment!�

Having spoken these words, she went over to the doctor.

�Cher docteur,� she said to him, �ce jeune homme est le fils du comte�y a-t-il de l�espoir?�

The doctor was silent, raising his eyes and shoulders with a quick movement. Anna Mikhailovna, with exactly the same movement, raised her shoulders and eyes, almost closing them, sighed, and walked away from the doctor towards Pierre. She addressed Pierre with special respectfulness and tender sorrow.

�Ayez confiance en sa mis&#233;ricorde!� she said to him and, pointing to a little settee on which he could sit and wait for her, made inaudibly for the door that everyone was looking at, and, following the barely audible noise of that door, disappeared behind it.

Pierre, having decided to obey his guide in all things, made for the little settee she had pointed out to him. As soon as Anna Mikhailovna disappeared, he noticed that the eyes of everyone in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they all exchanged whispers, indicating him with their eyes, as if with fear and even obsequiousness. He was being shown a respect no one had ever shown him before: a lady unknown to him, who had been talking with the clerical persons, got up from her place and offered him a seat; the adjutant picked up a glove Pierre had dropped and handed it to him; the doctors fell deferentially silent when he walked past them and stepped aside to make way for him. Pierre first wanted to sit somewhere else, so as not to inconvenience the lady, wanted to pick up the glove himself, and to bypass the doctors, who were not standing in his way; but he suddenly felt that that would be improper, he felt that that night he was the person responsible for performing some terrible rite which everyone expected, and that he therefore had to accept services from them all. He silently accepted the glove from the adjutant, sat down in the lady�s place, putting his big hands on his symmetrically displayed knees in the na&#239;ve pose of an Egyptian statue, and decided to himself that this was precisely as it had to be and that that evening, so as not to lose his head and do something foolish, he ought not to act according to his own reasoning, but give himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him.

Two minutes had not gone by before Prince Vassily, in his kaftan with three stars, holding his head high, majestically entered the room. He seemed to have grown thinner since morning; his eyes were larger than usual as he looked around and saw Pierre. He went over to him, took his hand (something he had never done before), and pulled it down, as if testing whether it was well attached.

�Courage, courage, mon ami. Il a demand&#233; de vous voir. C�est bien�� And he was about to leave.

But Pierre considered it necessary to ask:

�How is the health of�� He hesitated, not knowing whether it was proper to call the dying man �count� yet he was embarrassed to call him �father.�

�Il a eu encore un coup, il y a une demi-heure. Yet another stroke. Courage, mon ami��

Pierre was in such a state of mental confusion that, at the word �stroke,� he pictured some sort of blow to the body. He looked at Prince Vassily in perplexity, and only then realized that �stroke� referred to an illness. Prince Vassily spoke several words to Lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe. He did not know how to walk on tiptoe, and his whole body bobbed up and down awkwardly. The elder princess went in after him, then the clerical persons and the acolytes went in, then the servants also went through the door. Behind the door movement was heard, and finally, with the same face, pale but firm in the fulfillment of her duty, Anna Mikhailovna rushed out and, touching Pierre�s arm, said:

�La bont&#233; divine est in&#233;puisable. C�est la c&#233;r&#233;monie de l�extr&#234;me onction qui va commencer. Venez.�

Pierre went through the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed that the adjutant and the unknown lady, and some other servants�all came in after him, as if there was no longer any need to ask permission to enter that room.


XX

Pierre knew well that big room, divided by columns and an archway, all hung with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the columns, where on one side stood a high mahogany bed under a silk canopy and on the other an enormous stand with icons, was brightly lit with red light, as is usual in churches during evening services. Under the shining casings of the icons stood a long Voltaire armchair, and on the chair, its upper part spread with snow-white, unrumpled, apparently just-changed pillows, covered to the waist with a bright green coverlet, lay the majestic figure, so familiar to Pierre, of his father, Count Bezukhov, with the same mane of gray hair, reminiscent of a lion�s, above his broad forehead, and the same characteristically noble, deep furrows on his handsome reddish-yellow face. He lay directly under the icons; his two large, fat arms were freed of the coverlet and lay on top of it. In his right hand, which lay palm down, a wax candle had been placed between the thumb and the index finger, held in place by an old servant who reached from behind the armchair. Over the armchair stood the clerical persons in their majestic, shining vestments, their long hair spread loose on them, lighted candles in their hands, performing the service with slow solemnity. A little behind them stood the two younger princesses, holding handkerchiefs to their eyes, and in front of them the elder princess, Catiche, with a spiteful and resolute air, not taking her eyes off the icons for a moment, as if telling everyone that she would not answer for herself if she glanced back. Anna Mikhailovna, meek sorrow and all-forgiveness on her face, and the unknown lady stood by the door. Prince Vassily stood on the other side of the door, close to the armchair, behind a velvet-upholstered chair with its carved back turned to him, resting his elbow on it, holding a candle in his left hand, crossing himself with the right, raising his eyes each time he put the fingers to his forehead. His face expressed calm piety and submission to the will of God. �If you don�t understand these feelings, the worse for you,� his face seemed to say.

Behind him stood the adjutant, the doctors, and the male servants; the men and women were separated as in church. All were silent, crossing themselves, only the church reading could be heard, the restrained bass singing, and, in moments of silence, sighing and the shuffling of feet. Anna Mikhailovna, with a significant air which showed that she knew what she was doing, went all the way across the room to give Pierre a candle. He lit it and, diverted by observing the others, began to cross himself with the same hand in which he was holding the candle.

The youngest, the red-cheeked and laughter-prone Princess Sophie, with the little mole, looked at him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and did not uncover it for a long time; but, looking at Pierre, she laughed again. She evidently felt herself unable to look at him without laughing, but could not keep from looking at him, and, to avoid temptation, slowly moved behind a column. Midway through the service, the voices of the clergy suddenly fell silent; the clerical persons said something to each other in a whisper; the old servant who was holding the count�s hand straightened up and turned to the ladies. Anna Mikhailovna stepped forward and, bending over the sick man, beckoned behind her back for Lorrain to come. The French doctor�who stood without a lighted candle, leaning on a column, in the respectful pose of a foreigner, which showed that, despite differences of belief, he understood all the importance of the rite being performed and even approved of it�went over to the sick man with the inaudible steps of a man in the prime of life, took up his free hand from the green coverlet in his white, slender fingers, and, turning away, began taking his pulse and pondering. The sick man was given something to drink, there was stirring around him, then everyone went to their places and the service resumed. During this interruption, Pierre noticed that Prince Vassily came from behind the back of his chair and with that same look which showed that he knew what he was doing, and so much the worse for the others if they did not understand him, did not go up to the sick man, but passing by him, joined the eldest princess and together with her made for the depths of the bedroom, to the high bed under the silk canopy. From the bed, both prince and princess disappeared through a rear door, but before the end of the service they came back to their places one after the other. Pierre paid no more attention to this circumstance than to all the others, having decided in his mind once and for all that everything taking place before him that evening had necessarily to be so.

The sound of the church singing ceased, and the voice of the clerical person was heard deferentially congratulating the sick man with having received the sacrament. The sick man went on lying in the same way, lifelessly and motionlessly. Around him everyone stirred, footsteps and whispers were heard, among which the whisper of Anna Mikhailovna stood out more sharply than the rest.

Pierre heard her say:

�He must be transferred to his bed, here it will be quite impossible��

The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow head with its gray mane, which, though he did see other faces, had never once left his sight during the whole service. By the cautious movements of the people standing around the armchair, Pierre guessed that the dying man was being lifted up and transferred.

�Hold on to my arm, otherwise you�ll drop him,� the frightened whisper of one of the servants reached him, �from below�one more,� voices said, and the heavy breathing and the tread of people�s feet quickened, as if the load they were carrying was beyond their strength.

The carriers, who also included Anna Mikhailovna, came even with the young man, and for a moment, over people�s backs and necks, he saw the high, fleshy, bared chest and massive shoulders of the sick man, raised up by the people who held him under the arms, and his curly, gray leonine head. That head, with its extraordinarily wide brow and cheekbones, handsome sensual mouth, and majestic, cold gaze, was not disfigured by the proximity of death. It was the same as Pierre had known it three months earlier, when the count had seen him off to Petersburg. But this head swayed helplessly from the uneven steps of the carriers, and the cold, indifferent gaze did not know where to rest.

Several minutes were spent bustling around the high bed; the people who had carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikhailovna touched Pierre�s arm and said: �Venez.� Together with her, Pierre went up to the bed, on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose, evidently having to do with the just-received sacrament. He lay with his head resting on the highly propped pillows. His hands were symmetrically laid out, palms down, on the green silk coverlet. When Pierre went up, the count looked straight at him, but looked with a gaze the meaning and significance of which no man could possibly understand. Either this gaze said nothing at all, except that as long as one has eyes one must look somewhere, or it said all too much. Pierre stood there not knowing what to do, and looked questioningly at his guide, Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna made a hasty gesture with her eyes, indicating the sick man�s hand and sending it an airborne kiss with her lips. Pierre, diligently stretching his neck so as not to snag the coverlet, followed her advice and put his lips to the wide-boned and fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count�s face stirred. Pierre again looked questioningly at Anna Mikhailovna, asking what he was to do now. Anna Mikhailovna pointed him with her eyes to an armchair that stood by the bed. Pierre obediently began to sit down in the chair, his eyes still asking whether he was doing the right thing. Anna Mikhailovna nodded her head approvingly. Pierre again assumed the symmetrically na&#239;ve pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently regretting that his clumsy and fat body took up so much space, and applying all his inner forces to making himself seem as small as possible. He looked at the count. The count looked at the same place where Pierre�s face had been when he was standing. Anna Mikhailovna�s face expressed an awareness of the touching importance of this last-minute meeting of father and son. This went on for two minutes, which seemed like an hour to Pierre. Suddenly a shuddering came over the big muscles and furrows of the count�s face. The shuddering increased, the handsome mouth became contorted (only here did Pierre realize how close to death his father was), a vague, hoarse sound came from the contorted mouth. Anna Mikhailovna diligently looked into the sick man�s eyes, trying to guess what he wanted, pointed to Pierre, then to the drink, then in a questioning whisper named Prince Vassily, then pointed to the coverlet. The sick man�s eyes and face showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant who never left his post at the head of the bed.

�He would like to be turned on that side,� whispered the servant, and he got up to turn the count�s heavy body face to the wall.

Pierre stood up to help the servant.

As the count was being turned, one of his arms was left hanging helplessly, and he made a vain attempt to drag it over. Either the count noticed the horror with which Pierre looked at this lifeless arm, or some other thought flashed in his dying head at that moment, but he looked at the disobedient arm, at the expression of horror on Pierre�s face, at the arm again, and on his face there appeared�so incongruous with his features�a faint, suffering smile, as if expressing mockery at his own strengthlessness. Unexpectedly, at the sight of this smile, Pierre felt a shuddering in his breast, a tickling in his nose, and tears blurred his vision. The sick man was turned on his side to the wall. He sighed.

�Il est assoupi,� said Anna Mikhailovna, noticing the princess coming to replace them. �Allons.�

Pierre went out.


XXI

There was no one in the reception room now except Prince Vassily and the elder princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine having a lively talk. As soon as they saw Pierre with his guide, they fell silent. The princess hid something, as it seemed to Pierre, and whispered:

�I can�t bear that woman.�

�Catiche a fait donner du th&#233; dans le petit salon,� Prince Vassily said to Anna Mikhailovna. �Allez, ma pauvre Anna Mikhailovna, prenez quelque chose, autrement vous ne suffirez pas.�

He said nothing to Pierre, only squeezed his upper arm feelingly. Pierre and Anna Mikhailovna moved on to the small drawing room.

�Il n�y a rien qui restaure, comme une tasse de cet excellent th&#233; Russe apr&#232;s une nuit blanche,� said Lorrain, with an expression of restrained animation, sipping from a fine china cup without a handle, standing in the small, round drawing room in front of a table on which a tea service and a cold supper had been laid. Everyone who was in Count Bezukhov�s house that night gathered around the table to fortify themselves. Pierre remembered very well this small, round drawing room with its mirrors and little tables. During balls at the count�s house, Pierre, who danced poorly, liked to sit in this little room of mirrors and watch how ladies in ball gowns, with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders, passing through this room, looked at themselves in the brightly lit mirrors, which repeated their reflections several times. Now the same room was barely lit with two candles, and in the middle of the night a tea service and some dishes lay in disorder on one of the little tables, and various non-festive people, exchanging whispers, were sitting in it, showing with each movement, each word, that none of them had forgotten what was going on and was yet to be consummated in the bedroom. Pierre did not eat, though he very much wanted to. He glanced questioningly at his guide and saw her going out on tiptoe, back to the reception room, where Prince Vassily had remained with the elder princess. Pierre supposed that it had to be so, lingered a little, and followed her. Anna Mikhailovna was standing by the princess, and the two women were speaking simultaneously in agitated whispers.

�Allow me, Princess, to know what is and what is not necessary,� the younger woman was saying, evidently in the same agitated state she had been in when she had slammed the door to her room.

�But, my dear princess,� Anna Mikhailovna was saying meekly and persuasively, barring the way to the bedroom and preventing the princess from going in, �won�t it be too hard on poor, dear uncle at such a moment, when he needs rest? To talk about worldly things at such a moment, when his soul is already prepared��

Prince Vassily was sitting in an armchair, in his casual pose, one leg crossed high up over the other. His cheeks were twitching badly, and, when they slackened, seemed fatter below; but he had the look of a man who was little taken up with the conversation of the two ladies.

�Voyons, ma bonne Anna Mikhailovna, laissez faire Catiche. You know how the count loves her.�

�I don�t even know what�s in this document,� said the princess, turning to Prince Vassily and pointing to the inlaid portfolio she was holding in her hands. �I only know that the real will is in his desk, and this is a forgotten document�� She tried to go around Anna Mikhailovna, but Anna Mikhailovna sprang over and again barred her way.

�I know, dear, good princess,� said Anna Mikhailovna, seizing the portfolio with her hand and so firmly that it was clear she would not soon let go of it. �Dear princess, I beg you, I beseech you, have pity on him. Je vous en conjure�

The princess said nothing. All that could be heard were the sounds of the efforts of the struggle over the portfolio. It was clear that if she did start to talk, it would not be flattering for Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna held on tight, but in spite of that her voice retained all its sweet, drawling softness.

�Pierre, come here, my friend. I think he won�t be out of place in the family council�isn�t that so, Prince?�

�Why are you silent, mon cousin?� the princess suddenly shouted so loudly that the people in the drawing room heard and were frightened by her voice. �Why are you silent, when here God knows who allows herself to interfere and make scenes on a dying�s man�s threshold? Intriguer!� she whispered spitefully and tugged at the portfolio with all her might, but Anna Mikhailovna went a few steps so as not to let go of the portfolio, and shifted her grip.

�Oh!� Prince Vassily said with reproach and astonishment. He got up. �C�est ridicule. Voyons, let go, I tell you.�

The princess let go.

�You, too!�

Anna Mikhailovna did not obey him.

�Let go, I tell you. I take it all upon myself. I�ll go and ask him. I�let that be enough for you.�

�Mais, mon prince,� said Anna Mikhailovna, �give him a moment�s rest after such a great sacrament. Here, Pierre, tell us your opinion,� she turned to the young man who, coming up close to them, looked with astonishment at the princess�s spiteful face, which had lost all decency, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vassily.

�Remember that you will answer for all the consequences,� Prince Vassily said sternly. �You don�t know what you�re doing.�

�Loathsome woman!� the princess cried, suddenly falling upon Anna Mikhailovna and tearing the portfolio from her.

Prince Vassily hung his head and spread his hands.

At that moment the door, that awful door at which Pierre had stared for so long and which had opened so softly, now opened noisily, banging against the wall, and the younger princess ran out clasping her hands.

�What are you doing!� she said desperately. �Il s�en va et vous me laissez seule.�

The elder princess dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikhailovna quickly bent down and, picking up the disputed object, ran to the bedroom. The elder princess and Prince Vassily came to their senses and followed her. A few minutes later, the elder princess was the first to come out, with a pale and dry face, biting her lower lip. At the sight of Pierre, her face showed irrepressible spite.

�Yes, rejoice now,� she said, �you�ve been waiting for this.�

And, bursting into sobs, she covered her face with a handkerchief and ran out of the room.

After the princess, Prince Vassily came out. Staggering, he reached the sofa on which Pierre was sitting and collapsed on it, covering his eyes with his hand. Pierre noted that he was pale and his lower jaw was twitching and shaking as in a fever.

�Ah, my friend!� he said, taking Pierre by the elbow; and in his voice there was sincerity and weakness, such as Pierre had never noticed in him before. �We sin so much, we deceive so much, and all for what? I�m over fifty, my friend�I�ll�Everything ends in death, everything. Death is terrible.� He wept.

Anna Mikhailovna was the last to come out. She went to Pierre with quiet, slow steps.

�Pierre!�� she said.

Pierre looked at her questioningly. She kissed the young man on the forehead, wetting it with tears. She paused.

�Il n�est plus��

Pierre looked at her through his spectacles.

�Allons, je vous reconduirai. T&#226;chez de pleurer. Rien ne soulage comme les larmes.�

She led him to the dark drawing room, and Pierre was glad that nobody could see his face. Anna Mikhailovna left him, and when she came back, he was sound asleep, his head resting on his arm.

The next morning Anna Mikhailovna said to Pierre:

�Oui, mon cher, c�est une grande perte pour nous tous. Je ne parle pas de vous. Mais Dieu vous soutiendra, vous &#234;tes jeune et vous voil&#224; &#224; la t&#234;te d�une immense fortune, je l�esp&#232;re. Le testament n�a pas &#233;t&#233; encore ouvert. Je vous connais assez pour savoir que cela ne vous tournera pas la t&#234;te, mais cela vous impose des devoirs, et il faut &#234;tre homme.�

Pierre was silent.

�Peut-&#234;tre plus tard je vous dirai, mon cher, que si je n�avais pas &#233;t&#233; l&#224;, Dieu sait ce que serait arriv&#233;. Vous savez mon oncle avant-hier encore me promettait de ne pas oublier Boris. Mais il n�a pas eu le temps. J�esp&#232;re, mon cher ami, que vous remplirez le d&#233;sir de votre p&#232;re.�

Pierre understood nothing and silently gazed at Anna Mikhailovna, blushing shyly. Having talked with Pierre, Anna Mikhailovna drove off to the Rostovs� and went to bed. She woke up in the morning and told the Rostovs and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bezukhov�s death. She said that the count had died as she would like to die, that his end had been not only touching, but also instructive; and the last meeting of the father and son had been so touching that she could not recall it without tears, and that she did not know who had behaved better in those terrible moments: the father, who remembered everything and everyone so well in the last minutes and said such touching things to the son; or Pierre, who was a pity to see, he was so crushed, but who nevertheless tried to hide his sorrow, so as not to upset his dying father. �C�est p&#233;nible, mais cela fait du bien; &#231;a &#233;l&#232;ve l�&#226;me de voir des hommes comme le vieux comte et son digne fils,� she said. She also told disapprovingly about the actions of the princess and Prince Vassily, but as a great secret and in a whisper.


XXII

At Bald Hills, the estate of Prince Nikolai Andreevich Bolkonsky, the arrival of the young Prince Andrei and the princess was expected any day; but that expectation did not disrupt the harmonious order in which life went on in the old prince�s house. General in Chief Prince Nikolai Andreevich, known in society as le roi de Prusse, had been banished to his country estate under Paul, and had lived uninterruptedly at Bald Hills ever since, with his daughter, Princess Marya, and her companion, Mlle Bourienne. And under the new reign, though he was permitted entry to the capitals, he went on living uninterruptedly in the country, saying that anyone who needed him could travel the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, but that he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to say that there were only two sources of human vice: idleness and superstition; and that there were only two virtues: activity and intelligence. He occupied himself personally with his daughter�s upbringing, and to develop the two chief virtues in her, gave her lessons in algebra and geometry and portioned out her whole life among constant studies. He himself was constantly occupied, now with writing his memoirs, now with higher mathematical calculations, now with turning snuff boxes on a lathe, now with working in the garden and supervising the construction work that never ceased on his estate. As the main condition for activity was order, so the order in his way of life was brought to the utmost degree of precision. His coming to the table was performed under the same invariable conditions, and not only at the same hour, but at the same minute. With the people around him, from his daughter to the servants, the prince was brusque and invariably demanding, and thus, without being cruel, inspired a fear and respect for himself such as the cruelest of men would not find it easy to obtain. Though he was retired and now had no importance in state affairs, every governor of the province in which the prince�s estate lay considered it his duty to call on him and, like the architect, the gardener, or Princess Marya, to wait at the appointed hour for the prince to come out to the high-ceilinged waiting room. And each person in the waiting room experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear at the moment when the immensely high door to the study opened and revealed the small figure of the old man, in a powdered wig, with small dry hands and gray beetling brows, which sometimes, when he frowned, hid the brightness of his intelligent and youthfully bright eyes.

On the day of the young couple�s arrival, in the morning, as usual, Princess Marya went into the waiting room at the appointed hour for the morning greeting and fearfully crossed herself and inwardly recited a prayer. Every day she went in and every day she prayed that this daily meeting would go well.

A powdered old servant who was sitting in the waiting room got up with a quiet movement and in a whisper announced: �If you please.�

From behind the door came the regular sounds of a lathe. The princess timidly pulled the easily and smoothly opening door and stopped in the doorway. The prince was working at the lathe and, having glanced at her, went on with what he was doing.

The immense study was filled with things obviously in constant use. The big table with books and plans lying on it, the tall bookcases with keys in their glass doors, the tall table for writing in a standing position, on which lay an open notebook, the lathe with tools laid out and wood shavings strewn around it�everything spoke of constant, diverse, and orderly activity. By the movements of the small foot shod in a silver-embroidered Tartar boot, by the firm pressure of the sinewy, lean hand, one could see in the prince the still persistent and much-enduring strength of fresh old age. Having made a few more turns, he took his foot from the pedal of the lathe, wiped the chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, going to the table, called his daughter over. He never blessed his children, but, offering her his bristly, as yet unshaven cheek and giving her a stern and at the same time attentively tender look, merely said:

�Are you well?�Sit down, then!�

He took the geometry notebook, written in his own hand, and moved a chair over with his foot.

�For tomorrow!� he said, quickly finding the page and marking it paragraph by paragraph with his hard fingernail.

The princess bent to the table over the notebook.

�Wait, there�s a letter for you,� the old man said suddenly, taking an envelope with a woman�s handwriting on it from a pouch attached to the table and dropping it in front of her.

At the sight of the letter, the princess�s face became covered with red blotches. She hastily took it and bent over it.

�From H&#233;lo&#239;se?� asked the prince, baring his still strong and yellowish teeth in a cold smile.

�Yes, from Julie,� said the princess, glancing up timidily and smiling timidly.

�I�ll skip two letters and read the third,� the prince said sternly. �I�m afraid you write a lot of nonsense. I�ll read the third.�

�You can read this one, mon p&#232;re,� the princess replied, blushing still more and handing him the letter.

�The third, I said, the third,� the prince shouted curtly, pushing the letter away, and, leaning his elbow on the table, he drew the notebook with geometric drawings towards him.

�Well, ma�am,� the old man began, bending close to his daughter over the notebook and putting one arm on the back of the chair in which the princess was sitting, so that the princess felt herself surrounded on all sides by her father�s smell of tobacco and pungent old age, which she had known so long. �Well, ma�am, these triangles are similar; kindly look, the angle ABC��

The princess glanced fearfully at her father�s bright eyes, so near to her; red blotches came over her face, and it was obvious that she understood nothing, and was so afraid that fear would prevent her from understanding all of her father�s further explanations, however clear they were. Whether it was the teacher or the pupil who was at fault, the same thing repeated itself each day: the princess felt giddy, saw nothing, heard nothing, but only felt the lean face of her stern father near her, felt his breathing and his smell, and thought only of how to get out of the study as quickly as possible and work out the problem in the freedom of her own room. The old man would get beside himself: he would noisily move the chair he was sitting in back and forth, try hard to keep himself from flying into a rage, and almost always flew into a rage, poured out abuse, and sometimes flung the notebook away.

The princess gave the wrong answer.

�Well, aren�t you a fool!� shouted the prince, shoving the notebook away, but he got up at once, paced about, touched the princess�s hair with his hands, and sat down again.

He moved closer and continued his explanations.

�It won�t do, Princess, it won�t do,� he said, when the princess, having taken and closed the notebook with the next day�s lesson, was getting ready to leave. �Mathematics is a great thing, my lady. And I don�t want you to be like our stupid women here. Much patience, much pleasure.� He patted her on the cheek. �It will knock the foolishness out of your head.�

She was about to leave, but he gestured for her to stop and took a new, uncut book from the tall table.

�Here�s some Key to the Mystery your H&#233;lo&#239;se sends you. Religious. But I don�t interfere with anyone�s beliefs�I�ve looked through it. Take it. Well, off with you, off with you!�

He patted her on the shoulder and locked the door behind her himself.

Princess Marya went back to her room with the sad, frightened expression which rarely left her and made her unattractive, sickly face still more unattractive, and sat down at her desk, covered with miniature portraits and heaped with books and notebooks. The princess was as disorderly as her father was orderly. She put down her geometry notebook and impatiently unsealed the letter. The letter was from the princess�s closest childhood friend; this friend was that same Julie Karagin who had been at the Rostovs� name-day party.

Julie wrote:


Ch&#232;re et excellente amie, quelle chose terrible et effrayante que l�absence! J�ai beau me dire que la moiti&#233; de mon existence et de mon bonheur est en vous, que malgr&#233; la distance qui nous s&#233;pare, nos coeurs sont unis par des liens indissolubles; le mien se r&#233;volte contre la destin&#233;e, et je ne puis, malgr&#233; les plaisirs et les distractions qui m�entourent, vaincre une certaine tristesse cach&#233;e que je ressens au fond du coeur depuis notre s&#233;paration. Pourquoi ne sommes-nous pas r&#233;unies, comme cette &#233;t&#233; dans votre grand cabinet sur le canap&#233; bleu, le canap&#233; &#224; confidences? Pourquoi ne puis-je, comme il y a trois mois, puiser de nouvelles forces morales dans votre regard si doux, si calme et si p&#233;n&#233;trant, regard que j�aimais tant et que je crois voir devant moi, quand je vous &#233;cris?


Having read that far, Princess Marya sighed and glanced into the pier glass that stood to the right of her. The mirror reflected an unattractive, weak body and a thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked into the mirror with particular hopelessness. �She�s flattering me,� thought the princess, and she turned away and went on reading. Julie, however, was not flattering her friend: indeed, the princess�s eyes, large, deep, and luminous (sometimes it was as if rays of warm light came from them in sheaves), were so beautiful that very often, despite the unattractiveness of the whole face, those eyes were more attractive than beauty. But the princess had never seen the good expression of those eyes, the expression they had in moments when she was not thinking of herself. As with all people, the moment she looked in the mirror, her face assumed a strained, unnatural, bad expression. She went on reading:

Tout Moscou ne parle que guerre.L�un de mes deux fr&#232;res est d&#233;j&#224; a l�&#233;tranger, l�autre est avec la garde, qui se met en marche vers la fronti&#232;re. Notre cher empereur a quitt&#233; P&#233;tersbourg et, &#224; ce qu�on pr&#233;tend, compte lui-m&#234;me exposer sa pr&#233;cieuse existence aux chances de la guerre. Dieu veuille que le monstre corsicain, qui d&#233;truit le repos de l�Europe, soit terrass&#233; par l�ange que le tout-puissant, dans sa mis&#233;ricorde, nous a donn&#233; pour souverain. Sans parler de mes fr&#232;res, cette guerre m�a priv&#233;e d�une relation des plus ch&#232;res &#224; mon coeur. Je parle du jeune Nicolas Rostoff, qui avec son enthousiasme n�a pu supporter l�inaction et a quitt&#233; l�universit&#233; pour aller s�enr&#244;ler dans l�arm&#233;e. Eh bien, ch&#232;re Marie, je vous avouerai, que, malgr&#233; son extr&#234;me jeunesse, son d&#233;part pour l�arm&#233;e a &#233;t&#233; un grand chagrin pour moi. Le jeune homme, dont je vous parlais cet &#233;t&#233;, a tant de noblesse, de veritable jeunesse qu�on rencontre si rarement dans le si&#232;cle o&#249; nous vivons parmi nos viellards de vingt ans. Il a surtout tant de franchise et de coeur. Il est tellement pur et po&#233;tique, que mes relations avec lui, quelques passag&#232;res qu�elles fussent, ont &#233;t&#233; l�une des plus douces jouissances de mon pauvre coeur, qui a d&#233;j&#224; tant souffert. Je vous raconterai un jour nos adieux et tout ce qui s�est dit en partant. Tout cela est encore trop frais. Ah! ch&#232;re amie, vous &#234;tes heureuse de ne pas conna&#238;tre ces jouissances et ces peines si poignantes. Vous &#234;tes heureuse, puisque les derni&#232;res�sont ordinairement les plus fortes! Je sais fort bien que le comte Nicolas est trop jeune pour pouvoir jamais devenir pour moi quelque chose de plus qu�un ami, mais cette douce amiti&#233;, ces relations si po&#233;tiques et si pures ont &#233;t&#233; un besoin pour mon coeur. Mais n�en parlons plus. La grande nouvelle du jour qui occupe tout Moscou est la mort du vieux comte Bezukhov et son h&#233;ritage. Figurez-vous que les trois princesses n�ont re&#231;u que tr&#232;s peu de chose, le prince Basile rien, et que c�est M. Pierre qui a tout h&#233;rit&#233;, et qui par-dessus le march&#233; a &#233;t&#233; reconnu pour fils l&#233;gitime, par cons&#233;quant comte Bezukhov et possesseur de la plus belle fortune de la Russie. On pr&#233;tend que le prince Basile a jou&#233; un tr&#232;s vilain r&#244;le dans toute cette histoire et qu�il est reparti tout penaud pour P&#233;tersbourg.

Je vous avoue, que je comprends tr&#232;s peu toutes ces affaires de legs et de testament; ce que je sais, c�est que depuis que le jeune homme que nous connaissions tous sous le nom de M. Pierre tout court est devenu comte Bezukhov et possesseur de l�une des plus grandes fortunes de la Russie, je m�amuse fort &#224; observer les changements de ton et des mani&#232;res des mamans accabl&#233;es de filles &#224; marier et des demoiselles elles-m&#234;mes &#224; l�&#233;gard de cet individu, qui, par parenth&#232;se, m�a paru toujours &#234;tre un pauvre sire. Comme on s�amuse depuis deux ans &#224; me donner des promis que je ne connais pas le plus souvent, la chronique matrimoniale de Moscou me fait comtesse Bezukhov. Mais vous sentez bien que je ne me soucie nullement de le devenir. A propos de mariage, savez-vous que tout derni&#232;rement la �tante en g&#233;n&#233;rale� Anna Mikhailovna m�a confi&#233; sous le sceau du plus grand secret un projet de mariage pour vous. Ce n�est ni plus ni moins, que le fils du prince Basile, Anatole, qu�on voudrait ranger en le mariant &#224; une personne riche et distingu&#233;e, et c�est sur vous qu�est tomb&#233; le choix des parents. Je ne sais comment vous envisagerez la chose, mais j�ai cru de mon devoir de vous en avertir. On le dit tr&#232;s beau et tr&#232;s mauvais sujet; c�est tout ce que j�ai pu savoir sur son compte.

Mais assez de bavardage comme cela. Je finis mon second feuillet, et maman me fait chercher pour aller d&#238;ner chez les Apraksines. Lisez le livre mystique que je vous envoie et qui fait fureur chez nous. Quoiqu�il y ait des choses dans ce livre difficiles &#224; atteindre avec la faible conception humaine, c�est un livre admirable dont la lecture calme et &#233;l&#232;ve l�&#226;me. Adieu. Mes respects &#224; monsieur votre p&#232;re et mes compliments &#224; mlle Bourienne. Je vous embrasse comme je vous aime.

Julie.

P.S. Donnez-moi des nouvelles de votre fr&#232;re et de sa charmante petite femme.

The princess pondered, smiled pensively (at which her face, lit up by her luminous eyes, was completely transformed) and, suddenly getting up, went with her heavy step to the desk. She took out some paper, and her hand quickly began moving across it. This is what she wrote in reply:

Ch&#232;re et excellente amie.Votre lettre du 13 m�a caus&#233; une grande joie. Vous m�aimez donc toujours, ma po&#233;tique Julie. L�absence, dont vous dites tant de mal, n�a donc pas eu son influence habituelle sur vous. Vous vous plaignez de l�absence�que devrai-je dire moi si j�osais me plaindre, priv&#233;e de tous ceux qui me sont chers? Ah! si nous n�avions pas la religion pour nous consoler, la vie serait bien triste. Pourquoi me supposez-vous un regard s&#233;v&#232;re, quand vous me parlez de votre affection pour le jeune homme? Sous ce rapport je ne suis rigide que pour moi. Je comprends ces sentiments chez les autres et si je ne puis approuver ne les ayant jamais ressentis, je ne les condamne pas. Il me parait seulement que l�amour Chr&#233;tien, l�amour du prochain, l�amour pour ses ennemis est plus m&#233;ritoire, plus doux et plus beau, que ne le sont les sentiments que peuvent inspirer les beaux yeux d�un jeune homme &#224; une jeune fille po&#233;tique et aimante comme vous.

La nouvelle de la mort du comte Bezukhov nous est parvenue avant votre lettre, et mon p&#232;re en a &#233;t&#233; tr&#232;s affect&#233;. Il dit que c�&#233;tait l�avant-dernier repr&#233;sentant du grand si&#232;cle, et qu�a pr&#233;sent c�est son tour; mais qu�il fera son possible pour que son tour vienne le plus tard possible. Que Dieu nous garde de ce terrible malheur! Je ne puis partager votre opinion sur Pierre que j�ai connu enfant. Il me paraissait toujours avoir un coeur excellent, et c�est la qualit&#233; que j�estime le plus dans les gens. Quant &#224; son h&#233;ritage et au r&#244;le qu�y a jou&#233; le prince Basile, c�est bien triste pour tous les deux. Ah! ch&#232;re amie, la parole de notre divin Sauveur qu�il est plus ais&#233; &#224; un chameau de passer par le trou d�une aiguille, qu�il ne l�est &#224; un riche d�entrer dans le royaume de Dieu, cette parole est terriblement vraie; je plains le prince Basile et je regrette encore davantage Pierre. Si jeune et accabl&#233; de cette richesse, que de tentations n�aura-t-il pas a subir! Si on me demandait ce que je d&#233;sirerais le plus au monde, ce serait d�&#234;tre plus pauvre que le plus pauvre des mendiants. Mille gr&#226;ces, ch&#232;re amie, pour l�ouvrage que vous m�envoyez, et qui fait si grande fureur chez vous. Cependant, puisque vous me dites qu�au milieu de plusieurs bonnes choses il y en a d�autres que la faible conception humaine ne peut atteindre, il me para&#238;t assez inutile de s�occuper d�une lecture inintelligible; qui par l&#224; m&#234;me, ne pourrait &#234;tre d�aucun fruit. Je n�ai jamais pu comprendre la passion qu�ont certaines personnes de s�embrouiller l�entendement, en s�attachant &#224; des livres mystiques, qui n�&#233;l&#232;vent que des doutes dans leurs esprits, exaltent leur imagination et leur donnent un charact&#232;re d�exag&#233;ration tout-&#224;-fait contraire &#224; la simplicit&#233; Chr&#233;tienne. Lisons les Ap&#244;tres et l�&#201;vangile. Ne cherchons pas &#224; p&#233;n&#233;trer ce que ceux-l&#224; renferment de myst&#233;rieux, car, comment oserions-nous, mis&#233;rable p&#233;cheurs que nous sommes, pr&#233;tendre &#224; nous initier dans les secrets terribles et sacr&#233;s de la Providence, tant que nous portons cette d&#233;pouille charnelle, qui &#233;l&#232;ve entre nous et l�&#233;ternel un voile imp&#233;n&#233;trable? Bornons-nous donc &#224; &#233;tudier les principes sublimes que notre divin Sauveur nous a laiss&#233; pour notre conduite ici-bas; cherchons &#224; nous y conformer et &#224; les suivre, persuadons-nous que moins nous donnons d�essor &#224; notre faible esprit humain et plus il est agr&#233;able &#224; Dieu, qui rejette toute science ne venant pas de lui; que moins nous cherchons &#224; approfondir ce qu�il lui a plu de d&#233;rober &#224; notre connaissance, et plut&#244;t il nous en accordera la d&#233;couverte par son divin esprit.

Mon p&#232;re ne m�a pas parl&#233; du pr&#233;tendant, mais il m�a dit seulement qu�il a re&#231;u une lettre et attendait une visite du prince Basile. Pour ce qui est du projet de mariage qui me regarde, je vous dirai, ch&#232;re et excellente amie, que le mariage, selon moi, est une institution divine &#224; laquelle il faut se conformer. Quelque p&#233;nible que cela soit pour moi, si le Tout-puissant m�impose jamais les devoirs d�&#233;pouse et de m&#232;re, je t&#226;cherai de les remplir aussi fid&#232;lement que je le pourrai, sans m�inquieter de l�examen de mes sentiments &#224; l�&#233;gard de celui qu�il me donnera pour &#233;poux.

J�ai re&#231;u une lettre de mon fr&#232;re, qui m�annonce son arriv&#233;e &#224; Bald Hills avec sa femme. Ce sera une joie de courte dur&#233;e, puisqu�il nous quitte pour prendre part &#224; cette malheureuse guerre, &#224; laquelle nous sommes entra&#238;n&#233;s Dieu sait comment et pourquoi. Non seulement chez vous au centre des affaires et du monde on ne parle que de guerre, mais ici, au milieu de ces travaux champ&#234;tres et de ce calme de la nature que les citadins se repr&#233;sentent ordinairement &#224; la campagne, les bruits de la guerre se font entendre et sentir p&#233;niblement. Mon p&#232;re ne parle que marche et contremarche, choses auxquelles je ne comprends rien; et avant hier en faisant ma promenade habituelle dans la rue du village, je fus t&#233;moin d�une sc&#232;ne d&#233;chirante�C�&#233;tait un convoi des recrues enr&#244;l&#233;es chez nous et exp&#233;di&#233;es pour l�arm&#233;e�Il fallait voir l�&#233;tat dans lequel se trouvaient les m&#232;res, les femmes, les enfants des hommes qui partaient et entendre les sanglots des uns et des autres! On dirait que l�humanit&#233; a oubli&#233; les lois de son divin Sauveur, qui pr&#234;chait l�amour et le pardon des offenses, et qu�elle fait consister son plus grand m&#233;rite dans l�art de s�entretuer.

Adieu, ch&#232;re et bonne amie, que notre divin Sauveur et sa tr&#232;s sainte M&#232;re vous aient en leur sainte et puissante garde.

Marie.

�Ah, vous exp&#233;diez le courrier, princesse, moi j�ai d&#233;j&#224; expedi&#233; le mien. J�ai &#233;cris &#224; ma pauvre m&#232;re,� the smiling Mlle Bourienne spoke in a quick, pleasant, juicy little voice, swallowing her r�s and bringing with her into the concentrated, sad, and dreary atmosphere of Princess Marya a completely different, frivolously gay and self-contented world.

�Princesse, il faut que je vous pr&#233;vienne,� she added, lowering her voice, �le prince a eu une altercation,� she said, deliberately swallowing her r�s and listening to herself with pleasure, �une altercation avec Michel Ivanoff. Il est de tr&#232;s mauvaise humeur, tr&#232;s morose. Soyez pr&#233;venue, vous savez��

�Ah, ch&#232;re amie,� answered Princess Marya, �je vous ai pri&#233;e de ne jamais me pr&#233;venir de l�humeur dans laquelle se trouve mon p&#232;re. Je ne me permets pas de le juger, et je ne voudrais pas que les autres le fassent.�

The princess glanced at her watch and noticing that she was already five minutes late for playing the clavichord, went with a frightened face to the sitting room. According to the established order of the day, between noon and two o�clock the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord.


XXIII

The gray-haired valet sat dozing and listening to the prince�s snoring in the immense study. From the far side of the house, from behind a closed door, came the sounds of a Dusek sonata, the difficult passages repeated twenty times.

Just then a carriage and a britzka drove up to the porch, and from the carriage stepped Prince Andrei, who helped his little wife out and allowed her to go ahead. Gray-haired Tikhon, in a wig, stuck himself out the door of the waiting room, said in a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door. Tikhon knew that neither the son�s arrival nor any sort of extraordinary event was to interrupt the order of the day. Prince Andrei evidently knew it as well as Tikhon; he looked at his watch, as if to check whether his father�s habits had changed during the time he had not seen him, and, verifying that they had not, turned to his wife.

�He�ll get up in twenty minutes. Let�s go to Princess Marya,� he said.

The little princess had filled out during this time, but her eyes and her short lip with its little mustache and smile rose as gaily and sweetly as ever when she began to speak.

�Mais c�est un palais,� she said to her husband, looking around with the expression of someone paying compliments to the host at a ball. �Allons, vite, vite!�� Looking about, she smiled at Tikhon, and at her husband, and at the servant who accompanied them.

�C�est Marie qui s�exerce? Allons doucement, il faut la surprendre.�

Prince Andrei walked behind her with a polite and sad expression.

�You�ve aged, Tikhon,� he said to the old man, who kissed his hand as he passed.

Before the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came, a pretty blonde Frenchwoman popped out of a side door. Mlle Bourienne seemed wildly ecstatic.

�Ah! quel bonheur pour la princesse,� she said. �Enfin! Il faut que je la pr&#233;vienne.�

�Non, non, de gr&#226;ce�Vous &#234;tes Mlle Bourienne, je vous connais d&#233;j&#224; par l�amiti&#233; que vous porte ma belle-soeur,� said the princess, kissing her. �Elle ne nous attend pas!�

They went up to the door of the sitting room, through which came the sounds of the same passage repeated again and again. Prince Andrei stopped and winced, as if expecting something unpleasant.

The princess went in. The passage broke off in the middle; a cry was heard, then the heavy footsteps of Princess Marya and the sounds of kissing. When Prince Andrei went in, the two princesses, who had seen each other only once for a short time at Prince Andrei�s wedding, were standing with their arms around each other, their lips pressed hard to whatever place they had happened upon in the first moment. Mlle Bourienne was standing beside them, her hands pressed to her heart, smiling piously, apparently as ready to weep as to laugh. Prince Andrei shrugged his shoulders and winced, as music lovers wince when they hear a false note. The two women let go of each other, then again, as if fearing it would be too late, seized each other by the hands, began kissing, tore their hands away, and then again began kissing each other on the face, and, quite unexpectedly for Prince Andrei, they both wept and began to kiss again. Mlle Bourienne also wept. Prince Andrei obviously felt awkward; but for the two women it seemed natural to weep; it seemed it had never occurred to them that their meeting could be otherwise.

�Ah! ch&#232;re!�Ah! Marie!�� the two women suddenly began to speak and then laughed. �J�ai rev&#233; cette nuit�� �Vous ne nous attendiez donc pas?�� �Ah, Marie, vous avez maigri�� �Et vous avez repris��

�J�ai tout de suite reconnu madame la princesse,� Mlle Bourienne put in.

�Et moi qui ne me doutais pas!�� exclaimed Princess Marya. �Ah! Andr&#233;, je ne vous voyais pas.�

Prince Andrei and his sister kissed each other�s hands, and he told her she was the same pleurnicheuse she had always been. Princess Marya turned to her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm, and meek gaze of her big, luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment, rested on Prince Andrei�s face.

The little princess talked nonstop. Her short upper lip with its mustache would momentarily flit down, touching, where it had to, the rosy lower lip, and open up again in a smile of gleaming teeth and eyes. She told about an incident that had happened to her on Spasskoe Hill, which was dangerous for her in her condition, and just after that said she had left all her dresses in Petersburg and would go about here in God knows what, and that Andrei was quite changed, and that Kitty Ordyntsev had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Princess Marya pour tout de bon, but we�ll talk about that later. Princess Marya went on silently looking at her brother, and there was love and sadness in her beautiful eyes. It was clear that she had established her own train of thought, independent of her sister-in-law�s talk. In the middle of her story about the last f&#234;te in Petersburg, she addressed her brother.

�And you�re decidedly going to the war, Andr&#233;?� she said, sighing.

Lise also sighed.

�Tomorrow even,� her brother answered.

�Il m�abondonne ici et Dieu sait pourquoi, quand il aurait pu avoir de l�avancement��

Princess Marya did not finish listening and, continuing with the thread of her thoughts, turned to her sister-in-law, her gentle eyes indicating her stomach.

�Is it certain?� she asked.

The princess�s face changed. She sighed.

�Yes, certain,� she said. �Ah! It�s very frightening��

Liza�s little lip lowered. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law�s face and again wept unexpectedly.

�She needs rest,� said Prince Andrei, wincing. �Isn�t it so, Liza? Take her to your rooms, and I�ll go to father. How is he, the same?�

�The same, yes, the same; I don�t know whether in your eyes,� the princess replied joyfully.

�The same hours, and the strolls in the avenues? The lathe?� asked Prince Andrei with a barely perceptible smile, which showed that, despite all his love and respect for his father, he was aware of his weaknesses.

�The same hours, and the lathe, also mathematics, and my geometry lessons,� Princess Marya replied joyfully, as though her lessons in geometry were one of the most joyful impressions of her life.

When they had waited out the twenty minutes until it was time for the old prince to get up, Tikhon came to summon the young prince to his father. In honor of his son�s arrival, the old man had made an exception in his way of life: he gave orders to allow him into his part of the house while he was still dressing for dinner. The prince held to the old fashion of wearing a kaftan and powdering his hair. And at the moment when Prince Andrei (not with that peevish expression and manner he assumed in drawing rooms, but with the same animated face he had when he talked with Pierre) came to his father�s, the old man was sitting in his dressing room, on a wide morocco-upholstered armchair, in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tikhon�s hands.

�Ah! The warrior! So you want to defeat Bonaparte?� said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the braided queue, which was in Tikhon�s hands, would let him. �At least give him a good drubbing, or pretty soon he�ll be writing us down, too, as his subjects. Greetings!� And he offered his cheek.

The old man was in high spirits following his before-dinner nap. (He used to say that an after-dinner nap was silver, but a before-dinner nap was gold.) He joyfully cast sidelong glances at his son from under his thick, beetling brows. Prince Andrei went up and kissed his father on the place indicated to him. He did not respond to his father�s favorite subject�poking fun at the present-day military, and especially at Bonaparte.

�Yes, I�ve come to see you, papa, and with a pregnant wife,� said Prince Andrei, his animated and respectful eyes following the movement of every feature of his father�s face. �How is your health?�

�Only fools and profligates can be unwell, my boy, and you know me: I�m busy from morning till evening, I�m temperate, and so I�m well.�

�Thank God,� his son said, smiling.

�God has nothing to do with it. Well, tell me,� he went on, getting back on his hobbyhorse, �how have the Germans taught you to fight Bonaparte by this new science of yours known as strategy?�

Prince Andrei smiled.

�Let me collect my wits, papa,� he said, with a smile which showed that his father�s weaknesses did not prevent him from loving and respecting him. �I haven�t even settled in.�

�Nonsense, nonsense,� cried the old man, shaking his queue to see whether it was tightly braided and seizing his son�s arm. �The house is ready for your wife. Princess Marya will take her around and show her and babble three cartloads. That�s their womanish business. I�m glad of her. Sit down, tell me. Mikhelson�s army I understand, and Tolstoy�s�a simultaneous landing�What�s the southern army going to do? Prussia, neutrality�that I know. What about Austria?� he said, getting up from his chair and pacing the room, with Tikhon running after him and handing him pieces of clothing. �What about Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?�

Seeing his father�s insistent demand, Prince Andrei, reluctantly at first, but then with more and more animation, and inadvertently switching from Russian to French, out of habit, in the middle of his discourse, began to explain the plan of operations for the proposed campaign. He told how a ninety-thousand-man army was to threaten Prussia, so as to draw her out of neutrality and involve her in the war, how part of that army was to unite with the Swedish army in Strahlsund, how two hundred and twenty thousand Austrians, united with a hundred thousand Russians, were to go into action in Italy and on the Rhine, and how fifty thousand Russians and fifty thousand English would land at Naples, and how in all a five-hundred-thousand-strong army was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince showed not the slightest interest during the telling, as though he was not listening, and, continuing to dress as he paced, interrupted him three times unexpectedly. Once he stopped him and shouted:

�The white one! the white one!�

This meant that Tikhon had not handed him the waistcoat he wanted. Another time he stopped, asked:

�And how soon will she give birth?� and, shaking his head reproachfully, said: �Not good! Go on, go on.�

The third time, as Prince Andrei was finishing his description, the old man sang in an old man�s off-key voice: �Malbroug s�en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.�

His son merely smiled.

�I�m not saying that this is a plan I approve of,� the son said, �I�ve only told you what�s in it. Napoleon has already put together a plan no worse than this one.�

�Well, you haven�t told me anything new.� And the old man muttered pensively to himself in a quick patter: �Dieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room.�


XXIV

At the appointed hour, powdered and clean-shaven, the prince came out to the dining room, where he was awaited by his daughter-in-law, Princess Marya, Mlle Bourienne, and the prince�s architect, who by the prince�s strange caprice was admitted to the table, though by his insignificant position the man could in no way count on such an honor. The prince, who in his life kept firmly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important provincial officials to the table, suddenly decided to demonstrate by means of the architect Mikhail Ivanovich, who used to blow his nose in the corner on a checkered handkerchief, that all men are equal, and more than once impressed it upon his daughter that Mikhail Ivanovich was no worse than you or I. At table the prince most often addressed himself to the wordless Mikhail Ivanovich.

In the dining room, immensely high like all the rooms in the house, the prince�s entrance was awaited by the domestics and servants standing behind each chair; the butler, a napkin over his arm, examined the place settings, winking to the lackeys and constantly shifting his anxious gaze from the wall clock to the door from which the prince was to appear. Prince Andrei was looking at a huge gilded frame, new to him, with a picture of the family tree of the princes Bolkonsky, which hung across the room from an equally huge frame with a poorly painted portrait (obviously from the hand of a household artist) of a sovereign prince in a crown, who was supposed to be a descendant of Rurik and the first ancestor of the Bolkonsky family. Prince Andrei looked at this genealogical tree, shaking his head and chuckling with the air of someone looking at a portrait that is a ridiculously good likeness.

�That�s him all over!� he said to Prince Marya, who came up to him.

Princess Marya looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand what made him smile. Everything her father did evoked an awe in her which was not subject to discussion.

�Every man has his Achilles� heel,� Prince Andrei went on. �With his enormous intelligence, donner dans ce ridicule!�

Princess Marya could not understand her brother�s bold opinions and was getting ready to object to him when the awaited footsteps were heard from the study: the prince came in quickly, gaily, as he always did, as if deliberately contrasting his hasty manners to the strict order of the house. At the same moment, the big clock struck two and another in the drawing room responded in a high voice. The prince stopped; from under his thick, beetling brows, his lively, bright, stern eyes looked around at everyone and rested on the young princess. The young princess experienced at that moment the feeling courtiers experience at the appearance of the tsar, that feeling of fear and respect which this old man evoked in all those around him. He stroked the princess�s head and then, with an awkward gesture, patted her on the back of the neck.

�Delighted, delighted,� he said and, looking her intently in the eye once again, quickly stepped away and sat down in his place. �Sit down, sit down! Mikhail Ivanovich, sit down.�

He pointed his daughter-in-law to the place next to him. A servant pulled out the chair for her.

�Ho, ho!� said the old man, looking at her rounded waist. �Rushing things; that�s not good!�

He laughed drily, coldly, unpleasantly, as he always laughed�only with his mouth, not with his eyes.

�You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,� he said.

The little princess either did not hear or did not want to hear his words. She was silent and seemed embarrassed. The prince asked about her father, and the princess began to speak and smiled. He asked her about mutual acquaintances: the princess became still more animated and started talking away, giving the prince greetings and town gossip.

�La comtesse Apraksine, la pauvre, a perdu son mari et elle a pleur&#233; les larmes de ses yeux,� she said, becoming more and more animated.

As her animation increased, the prince looked at her more and more sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her enough and arrived at a clear idea of her, turned away and addressed Mikhail Ivanovich.

�Well, now, Mikhail Ivanovich, things are going badly for our friend Buonaparte. Prince Andrei� (he always referred to his son in the third person like this) �has just been telling me what forces are being prepared against him! But you and I always considered him an empty man.�

Mikhail Ivanovich, who had no idea when this you and I had spoken such words about Bonaparte, but who understood that he was needed in order to launch into the favorite subject, looked at the young prince in surprise, not knowing what would come of it.

�We have a great tactician here!� the prince said to his son, pointing to the architect.

And the conversation turned again to the war, to Bonaparte, and to today�s generals and statesmen. The old prince seemed to be convinced not only that all present-day men of action were mere boys, who did not even understand the ABC�s of military and state affairs, and that Bonaparte was a worthless little Frenchman who was successful only because there were no Potemkins and Suvorovs to oppose him; but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe, nor was there a war, but only some sort of marionette comedy that today�s people played at, pretending they meant business. Prince Andrei cheerfully endured his father�s mockery of the new people, and provoked his father to talk and listened to him with obvious delight.

�All that there was before seems good,� he said, �but wasn�t it that same Suvorov who fell into the trap set for him by Moreau and was unable to get out of it?�

�Who told you that? Who told you?� cried the prince. �Suvorov!� And he flung away his plate, which was deftly caught by Tikhon. �Suvorov!�Think a little, Prince Andrei. Two men: Friedrich and Suvorov�Moreau! Moreau would have been captured if Suvorov had had a free hand; but he had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-rath on his hands. Even the devil wouldn�t be glad of that. But go, and you�ll learn about these Hofs-kriegs-wursts-chnapps-raths! Suvorov couldn�t get on with them, how is Mikhail Kutuzov going to do it?! No, my friend,� he went on, �you and your generals won�t get around Bonaparte; you need to get hold of a Frenchman, so that their own don�t know their own, and their own beat their own. They sent the German Pahlen to New York, to America, to fetch the Frenchman Moreau,� he said, alluding to the invitation made to Moreau that year to enter the Russian service. �Wonders!! What, were the Potemkins, the Suvorovs, the Orlovs Germans? No, brother, either you�ve all lost your wits there, or mine have burnt out. God help you, but we�ll see. They take Bonaparte for a great general! Hm!��

�I�m by no means saying that all the plans are good,� said Prince Andrei, �only I can�t understand how you can make such a judgment about Bonaparte. Laugh all you like, but Bonaparte is still a great general!�

�Mikhail Ivanovich!� the old prince cried to the architect, who, being busy with the roast, had hoped to be forgotten. �Didn�t I tell you Bonaparte was a great tactician? Well, he says so, too.�

�Sure thing, Your Excellency,� replied the architect.

The prince again laughed his cold laugh.

�Bonaparte was born lucky. He has excellent soldiers. And the Germans were the first he attacked. You�d have to be a do-nothing not to beat the Germans. Ever since the world began, everybody�s beaten the Germans. And they�ve beaten nobody. Except each other. It was on them he earned his glory.�

And the prince began to analyze all the mistakes which, to his way of thinking, Bonaparte had made in all his wars and even in state affairs. His son did not object, but it was clear that, whatever the arguments presented to him, he was as little able to change his opinion as the old prince was. Prince Andrei listened, holding back his objections, and involuntarily amazed at how this old man, who had sat alone in the country uninterruptedly for so many years, could know and discuss, in such detail and with such subtlety, all the military and political circumstances of Europe in recent years.

�You think I�m an old man and don�t understand the real state of affairs,� he concluded. �But I have it all up here! I don�t sleep nights. So, where has this great general of yours shown himself?�

�That would be a long story,� said his son.

�Off with you to your Buonaparte, then. Mademoiselle Bourienne, voil&#224; encore un admirateur de votre goujat d�empereur!� he shouted in excellent French.

�Vous savez que je ne suis pas bonapartiste, mon prince.�

�Dieu sait quand reviendra�� the prince sang off-key, laughed still more off-key, and left the table.

All through the argument and the rest of dinner, the little princess was silent and kept glancing fearfully now at Princess Marya, now at her father-in-law. When they left the table, she took her sister-in-law by the arm and led her to another room.

�Comme c�est un homme d�esprit, votre p&#232;re,� she said, �c�est &#224; cause de cela peut-&#234;tre qu�il me fait peur.�

�Ah, he�s so kind!� said the princess.


XXV

Prince Andrei was leaving the next evening. The old prince, not abandoning his order, went to his rooms after dinner. The little princess was with her sister-in-law. Prince Andrei, dressed in a traveling frock coat without epaulettes, was packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him. He personally saw to the carriage and the loading of the trunks, and ordered the horses harnessed up. All that remained in the room were the objects Prince Andrei always carried with him: a strongbox, a big silver cellaret, two Turkish pistols, and a saber�a present from his father, brought back from Ochakov. All these traveling accessories Prince Andrei kept in great order: everything was new, clean, in broadcloth covers, carefully tied with tapes.

At moments of departure and a change of life, people capable of reflecting on their actions usually get into a serious state of mind. At these moments they usually take stock of the past and make plans for the future. Prince Andrei�s face was very thoughtful and tender. His hands behind his back, he paced rapidly up and down the room, looking straight ahead and thoughtfully shaking his head. Was he afraid of going to the war, was he sad to be leaving his wife�perhaps both, but, evidently not wishing to be seen in such a state, when he heard footsteps in the hallway, he quickly unclasped his hands, stopped by the table, pretending to tie the tapes on the strongbox cover, and assumed his usual calm and impenetrable expression. They were the heavy footsteps of Princess Marya.

�They told me you gave orders to harness up,� she said breathlessly (she had obviously come running), �and I wanted so much to talk more with you alone. God knows for how long we�re parting again. You�re not angry that I�ve come? You�ve changed very much, Andryusha,� she added, as if to explain her question.

She smiled as she pronounced the name Andryusha. It must have been strange to her to think that this stern, handsome man was that same Andryusha, a thin, frolicsome boy, her childhood companion.

�And where is Lise?� he asked, only smiling in answer to her question.

�She was so tired that she fell asleep in my room on the sofa. Ah, Andr&#233;! Quel tr&#233;sor de femme vous avez,� she said, sitting down on the sofa opposite her brother. �She�s a perfect child, such a dear, merry child. I�ve come to love her so.�

Prince Andrei was silent, but the princess noticed the ironic and scornful expression that appeared on his face.

�But one must be indulgent towards little weaknesses�who doesn�t have them, Andr&#233;! Don�t forget that she grew up and was formed in society. And then, her position now isn�t very rosy. One must enter into each person�s position. Tout comprendre, c�est tout pardonner. Just think how it is for the poor dear, in her condition, after the life she�s used to, to part with her husband and remain alone in the country? It�s very hard.�

Prince Andrei smiled, looking at his sister, as we smile listening to people whom we think we can see through.

�You live in the country, and you don�t find this life so terrible,� he said.

�I�m another matter. Why talk of me! I do not and cannot wish for any other life, because I don�t know any other life. But think, Andr&#233;, for a young and worldly woman, in the best years of her life, to be buried in the country, alone, because papa�s always busy, and I�you know me�how poor I am en ressources, for a woman accustomed to the best society. Mademoiselle Bourienne alone��

�I dislike her very much, your Bourienne,� said Prince Andrei.

�Oh, no! She�s a very dear and kind, and, above all, a pitiful girl. She has nobody, nobody. To tell the truth, she�s not only unnecessary to me, she�s even an inconvenience. You know, I�ve always been a wild creature, and now more than ever. I like being alone�Mon p&#232;re likes her very much. She and Mikhail Ivanovich are the two persons with whom he�s always gentle and kind, because he�s their benefactor. As Sterne says: �We love people not so much for the good they�ve done us, as for the good we�ve done them.� Mon p&#232;re took her as an orphan sur le pav&#233;, and she�s very kind. And mon p&#232;re likes her way of reading. She reads aloud to him in the evenings. She reads beautifully.�

�Well, but in truth, Marie, I wonder if father�s character isn�t sometimes hard on you?� Prince Andrei asked suddenly.

Princess Marya was first surprised, then frightened by this question.

�On me?�On me?! Hard on me?!� she said.

�He�s always been tough, but now I think he�s becoming difficult,� said Prince Andrei, probably speaking so lightly of their father on purpose, to puzzle or test his sister.

�You�re good in every way, Andr&#233;, but you have a sort of mental pride,� the princess said, following her own train of thought more than the course of the conversation, �and that is a great sin. Is it possible to judge one�s father? And even if it were possible, what other feeling than v&#233;n&#233;ration can a man like mon p&#232;re evoke? And I am so content and happy with him. I only wish everyone could be as happy as I am.�

Her brother shook his head mistrustfully.

�The one thing that�s hard for me�to tell you the truth, Andr&#233;�is father�s way of thinking in the religious respect. I don�t understand how a man with such an enormous intellect cannot see what is clear as day and can be so deluded. That constitutes my one unhappiness. But here, too, I�ve seen a shade of improvement recently. His mockery recently hasn�t been so biting, and there�s a monk whom he received and with whom he spoke for a long time.�

�Well, my friend, I�m afraid you and this monk are wasting your powder,� Prince Andrei said mockingly but affectionately.

�Ah, mon ami. I only pray to God and hope He will hear me. Andr&#233;,� she said timidly, after a moment�s silence, �I have a big request to make of you.�

�What is it, my friend?�

�No, promise me you won�t refuse. It won�t be any trouble for you, and there won�t be anything in it that�s unworthy of you. Only you�ll comfort me. Promise, Andryusha,� she said, putting her hand into her reticule and taking hold of something in it, but not showing it yet, as if what she was holding constituted the object of her request, and before she got his promise to fulfill her request, she could not take this something out of her reticule.

She looked at her brother with a timid, pleading gaze.

�Even if it was a great deal of trouble for me�� Prince Andrei said, as if guessing what it was about.

�You can think what you like! I know you�re the same as mon p&#232;re. Think what you like, but do it for me. Do it, please! Father�s father, our grandfather, wore it through all the wars�� She still would not take what she was holding out of the reticule. �So promise me?��

�Of course, what is it?�

�Andr&#233;, I�m going to bless you with an icon, and you promise me never to take it off�Do you promise?�

�Of course, if it doesn�t weigh a hundred pounds and pull my neck down�To give you pleasure�� said Prince Andrei, but that same second, noticing the distressed look that came to his sister�s face at this joke, he instantly repented. �I�m very glad, truly, very glad, my friend,� he added.

�Against your will He will save you and have mercy on you and turn you to Him, because in Him alone there is truth and peace,� she said in a voice trembling from emotion, with a solemn gesture holding up in both hands before her brother an old oval icon of the Savior with a blackened face, in a silver setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.

She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and gave it to Andrei.

�Please, Andr&#233;, for me��

From her big eyes shone rays of a kindly and timid light. These eyes lit up her whole thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother wanted to take the icon, but she stopped him. Andrei understood, made the sign of the cross, and kissed the icon. His face was at the same time tender (he was touched) and mocking.

�Merci, mon ami.�

She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa. They were silent.

�So as I was saying to you, Andr&#233;, be kind and magnanimous, as you�ve always been. Don�t judge Lise too severely,� she began. �She�s so dear, so kind, and her position is very hard now.�

�I don�t believe I�ve said anything to you, Masha, about reproaching my wife for anything or being displeased with her. Why are you saying all this to me?�

Princess Marya broke out in red blotches and said nothing, as if she felt guilty.

�I haven�t said anything to you, but it has already been said to you. And that makes me sad.�

The red blotches stood out still more on Princess Marya�s forehead, neck, and cheeks. She wanted to say something, but could not bring it out. Her brother had guessed right: the little princess had wept after dinner, had said she had a foreboding of a bad delivery, was afraid of it, and had complained about her life, her father-in-law, and her husband. After her tears, she had fallen asleep. Prince Andrei felt sorry for his sister.

�Know one thing, Masha, I cannot, have not, and never will reproach my wife for anything, nor can I reproach myself for anything in relation to her; and that will always be so, whatever circumstances I find myself in. But if you want to know the truth�if you want to know whether I�m happy? No. Is she happy? No. Why is that? I don�t know��

As he was saying this, he got up, went over to his sister, and, bending down, kissed her on the forehead. His fine eyes shone with an intelligent and kindly, unhabitual light, but he was looking not at his sister but into the darkness of the open doorway, over her head.

�Let�s go to her, I must say good-bye! Or you go alone, wake her up, and I�ll come presently. Petrushka!� he called to his valet. �Come here, take these things out. This goes under the seat, this to the right-hand side.�

Princess Marya got up and went to the door. She paused.

�Andr&#233;, si vous avez la foi, vous vous seriez adress&#233; &#224; Dieu, pour qu�il vous donne l�amour que vous ne sentez pas, et votre pri&#232;re aurait &#233;t&#233; exauc&#233;e.�

�Yes�there�s always that!� said Prince Andrei. �Go, Masha, I�ll come presently.�

On the way to his sister�s room, in the gallery that connected one house to the other, Prince Andrei met the sweetly smiling Mlle Bourienne, who three times that day had already run into him with her rapturous and na&#239;ve smile in secluded passages.

�Ah! je vous croyais chez vous,� she said, blushing and lowering her eyes for some reason.

Prince Andrei looked at her sternly. A spiteful look suddenly came to Prince Andrei�s face. He said nothing to her, but, avoiding her eyes, looked at her forehead and hair with such scorn that the Frenchwoman blushed and left without saying anything. When he approached his sister�s room, the princess was already awake, and her merry little voice could be heard through the open door hurriedly sending out one word after another. She was talking as if, after a long abstinence, she wanted to make up for lost time.

�Non, mais figurez-vous, la vieille comtesse Zouboff avec des fausses boucles et la bouche pleine de fausses dents, comme si elle voulait d&#233;fier les ann&#233;es� Ha, ha, ha, Marie!�

Five times already, with other people, Prince Andrei had heard exactly the same phrase about the countess Zubov and the same laughter from his wife. He quietly went into the room. The princess, round, rosy, with her work in her hands, was sitting in an armchair and talking non-stop, telling over her Petersburg memories and even phrases. Prince Andrei went to her, stroked her head, and asked whether she had rested from the journey. She made a reply and went on with the same talk.

The coach and six was standing at the porch. Outside it was a dark autumn night. The coachman could not see the shafts of the carriage. On the porch people with lanterns bustled about. Lights shone through the big windows of the immense house. The domestic servants crowded in the front hall, wishing to say good-bye to the young prince; in the reception room stood the whole household: Mikhail Ivanovich, Mlle Bourienne, Princess Marya, and the little princess. Prince Andrei had been summoned to his father�s study, where the old prince wanted to say good-bye to him man to man. Everyone was waiting for them to emerge.

When Prince Andrei went into the study, the old prince, in his old man�s spectacles and his white smock, in which he received no one except his son, was sitting at the table and writing. He looked up.

�You�re leaving?� And he started writing again.

�I�ve come to say good-bye.�

�Kiss me here,� he pointed to his cheek. �Thank you, thank you!�

�What are you thanking me for?�

�For not overstaying and clinging to a woman�s skirt. Service before all. Thank you, thank you!� And he went on writing, so that spatters flew from his scratching pen. �If you want to say something, speak. I can do the two things at once,� he added.

�About my wife�I�m so ashamed to be leaving her on your hands��

�What�s this drivel? Say what you want.�

�When it�s time for my wife to give birth, send to Moscow for an accoucheur �So that he�ll be here.�

The old prince stopped and, as if unable to understand, stared with stern eyes at his son.

�I know no one can help if nature doesn�t help,� Prince Andrei said, visibly embarrassed. �I agree that only one case in a million ends badly, but it�s her and my fantasy. People have said things to her, she�s had dreams, and she�s afraid.�

�Hm�hm�� the old prince said to himself, still writing. �I�ll do it.�

He signed with a flourish, suddenly turned quickly to his son, and laughed.

�A bad business, eh?�

�What is, papa?�

�A wife!� the old prince said curtly and significantly.

�I don�t understand,� said Prince Andrei.

�Nothing to be done, my friend,� said the prince, �they�re all like that, no use unmarrying. Don�t be afraid; I won�t tell anybody; but you know it yourself.�

He seized his hand in his bony little fist, shook it, looked straight into his son�s face with his quick eyes that seemed to see through a person, and again laughed his cold laugh.

The son sighed, admitting by this sigh that his father had understood him. The old man, continuing to fold and seal letters with his habitual dexterity, kept snatching up and throwing down wax, seal, and paper.

�What can you do? She�s beautiful! I�ll do everything. You can rest easy,� he said brusquely while sealing a letter.

Andrei said nothing: he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him. The old man got up and handed the letter to his son.

�Listen,� he said, �don�t worry about your wife: whatever can be done, will be done. Now listen: give this letter to Mikhail Ilarionovich. I write that he should use you in good posts and not keep you long as an adjutant: nasty duty! Tell him I remember him and love him. And write and tell me how he receives you. If he�s all right, serve him. Nikolai Andreevich Bolkonsky�s son won�t serve anyone on charity. Well, now come here.�

He spoke so quickly that half the words remained unfinished, but his son was used to understanding him. He led his son to the desk, opened the lid, pulled out a drawer, and took from it a notebook filled with his bold, tall, compact handwriting.

�I�m sure to die before you. Know that these are my journals, to be given to the sovereign after my death. Now here is a Lombard note and a letter: it�s a prize for whoever writes the history of Suvorov�s campaigns. To be sent to the Academy. Here are my jottings, read them for yourself when I�m gone, you�ll find useful things.�

Andrei did not tell his father that he would probably live for a long time yet. He understood that there was no need to say it.

�I�ll do it all, father,� he said.

�Well, and now good-bye!� He gave his son his hand to kiss and embraced him. �Remember one thing, Prince Andrei: if you�re killed, I, your old father, will be pained�� He unexpectedly fell silent and suddenly went on in a shrill voice: �But if I learn that you have not behaved like Nikolai Bolkonsky�s son, I will be ashamed!� he shrieked.

�That you might not have told me, father,� the son said, smiling.

The old man fell silent.

�I also wanted to ask you,� Prince Andrei continued, �if I�m killed, and if I should have a son, don�t let him leave you, as I told you yesterday; he should grow up here with you�please.�

�Not give him to your wife?� the old man said and laughed.

They stood silently facing each other. The old man�s quick eyes were aimed straight into his son�s eyes. Something twitched in the lower part of the old prince�s face.

�We�ve said our good-byes�off with you!� he said suddenly. �Off with you!� he shouted in a loud and angry voice, opening the door of the study.

�What is it? What�s wrong?� asked both princesses, seeing Prince Andrei and the momentarily emerging figure of the old man in a white smock, wigless, and in an old man�s spectacles, shouting in an angry voice.

Prince Andrei sighed and said nothing.

�Well,� he said, turning to his wife, and this �well� sounded like cold mockery, as if he had said: �Now perform your tricks.�

�Andr&#233;, d&#233;j&#224;?� the little princess said, turning pale and looking at her husband in fear.

He embraced her. She cried out and fell unconscious on his shoulder.

He cautiously withdrew the shoulder she was lying on, looked into her face, and carefully seated her in an armchair.

�Adieu, Marie,� he said softly to his sister, they kissed each other�s hands, and with quick steps he walked out of the room.

The princess lay in the armchair, and Mlle Bourienne rubbed her temples. Princess Marya, supporting her sister-in-law, went on looking with her beautiful, tear-filled eyes at the door through which Prince Andrei had gone and making signs of the cross at him. From the study, like gunshots, came the oft-repeated angry sounds of the old man blowing his nose. As soon as Prince Andrei left, the door to the study quickly opened, and the old man�s stern figure appeared in its white smock.

�Gone? Well, that�s good!� he said, gave the unconscious little princess an angry look, shook his head reproachfully, and slammed the door.



��������� Part Two ���������


I

In October 1805 Russian troops were occupying villages and towns in the archduchy of Austria, and more new regiments kept arriving from Russia to be stationed by the fortress of Braunau, burdening the local inhabitants with their billeting. In Braunau the commander in chief, Kutuzov, had his headquarters.

On the eleventh of October, 1805, one of the infantry regiments just arrived in Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be reviewed by the commander in chief. Despite the non-Russian locality and surroundings�orchards, stone walls, tile roofs, mountains visible in the distance�and the non-Russian folk gazing with curiosity at the soldiers, the regiment looked exactly the same as any Russian regiment waiting for review somewhere in central Russia.

In the evening of the latest march an order had been received that the commander in chief would review the regiment on the march. Though the wording of the order seemed unclear to the regimental commander and the question arose of how to take the wording of the order�in marching uniform or not?�in the council of battalion commanders it was decided to present the regiment for review in parade uniform, on the grounds that it is always better to bow too much than not to bow enough. And so the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, without a wink of sleep, spent the whole night mending and cleaning; the adjutants and company commanders calculated and counted off; and by morning the regiment, instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been the day before, during the latest march, was a well-ordered mass of two thousand men, each of whom knew his place, his duty, each of whose buttons and straps was in its place and sparkling clean. Not only were the externals in good order, but if it should please the commander in chief to look under the uniform, he would see on each man the same clean shirt, and in each pack he would find the prescribed number of things, �the whole kit and caboodle,� as soldiers say. There was only one circumstance with regard to which no one could be at ease. This was footgear. More than half the men had their boots falling to pieces. But this shortcoming was not the regimental commander�s fault, since, despite his repeated requests, the Austrian department had not released a supply, and the regiment had walked seven hundred miles.

The regimental commander was an elderly, sanguine general with grizzled eyebrows and side-whiskers, stocky and broader from chest to back than from shoulder to shoulder. He was wearing a brand-new uniform with creases from being packed away, and thick gold epaulettes which seemed not to weigh down but to lift up his massive shoulders. The regimental commander had the look of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties in life. He strolled about before the front line, bouncing at each step as he strolled, and arching his back slightly. It was clear that the regimental commander admired his regiment, was happy with it, and that all his inner forces were taken up only with the regiment; but, in spite of that, his bouncing gait seemed to say that, besides military interests, no small part of his soul was taken up by the interests of social life and the female sex.

�Well, Mikhailo Mitrich, old boy,� he addressed one of the battalion commanders (the battalion commander, smiling, moved forward; it was clear that both men were happy), �we were hard put to it last night. However, it seems the regiment�s not such a bad one�Eh?�

The battalion commander understood the merry irony and laughed.

�Wouldn�t even be driven off the Tsaritsyn Field.�

�What?�

Just then two horsemen appeared on the road from town along which signalmen had been posted. They were an adjutant with a Cossack riding behind him.

The adjutant had been sent from headquarters to confirm to the regimental commander what had been said unclearly in the previous day�s order, namely, that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment in exactly the same condition it had been in on the march�in greatcoats, in dustcovers, and without any preparations.

The day before, a member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutuzov with proposals and demands that he go as quickly as possible to join with the army of the archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutuzov, who did not consider that juncture advantageous, intended, among other arguments in favor of his opinion, to show the Austrian general the sorry condition in which his troops arrived from Russia. It was with that purpose that he wanted to come and meet the regiment, so that the worse the condition of the regiment was, the more pleasing it would be to the commander in chief. Though the adjutant did not know these details, he conveyed to the regimental commander the absolute demand of the commander in chief that his people be in greatcoats and dustcovers, and that in the contrary case the commander in chief would be displeased.

Having listened to these words, the regimental commander hung his head, silently heaved his shoulders, and spread his arms in a sanguine gesture.

�Now we�ve done it!� he said. �See, I told you, Mikhailo Mitrich, if it�s on the march, then it�s greatcoats,� he turned reproachfully to the battalion commander. �Ah, my God!� he added and resolutely stepped forward. �Company commanders!� he cried in a voice accustomed to command. �Sergeant majors!�How soon will he come?� he turned to the adjutant with an expression of deferential politeness which evidently related to the person of whom he was speaking.

�In an hour, I think.�

�Do we have time to change?�

�I don�t know, General��

The regimental commander approached the ranks himself and gave orders to change back into overcoats. The company commanders ran to their companies, the sergeant majors began bustling about (the overcoats were not in good order), and that same instant the previously orderly, silent rectangles heaved, stretched, and began humming with talk. Soldiers ran back and forth on all sides, tossed their packs off one shoulder and pulled them over their heads, took their overcoats out, and raised their arms high, putting them into the sleeves.

Half an hour later everything was back in its former order, only the rectangles had become gray instead of black. The regimental commander again stepped before the regiment with his bouncing gait and looked it over from a distance.

�What�s this now? what�s this?� he shouted, stopping. �Commander of the third company!��

�Commander of the third company to the general! commander to the general, third company to the commander!�� voices were heard in the ranks, and an adjutant ran to look for the belated officer.

When the sounds of the zealous voices, distorting the message and now shouting �the general to the third company,� reached their destination, the summoned officer emerged from the back of the ranks and, though already an elderly man and not accustomed to running, cantered, clumsily tripping over his toes, towards the general. The captain�s face expressed the anxiety of a schoolboy who is asked to recite a lesson he had not learned. Blotches appeared on his red (evidently from intemperance) face, and his mouth would not stay put. The regimental commander looked the captain up and down as he approached, puffing, slackening his pace the nearer he came.

�Soon you�ll have your people dressed in sarafans! What is that?� shouted the regimental commander, thrusting his lower jaw out and pointing to a soldier in the ranks of the third company who was wearing a greatcoat of blue factory broadcloth, different from the other greatcoats. �Where have you been? We�re expecting the commander in chief, and you leave your post? Eh?�I�ll teach you to dress your people in gaudy colors for a review!�Eh!��

The company commander, not taking his eyes off his superior officer, pressed his two fingers more and more firmly to his visor, as if he now saw salvation only in this pressing.

�Well, why are you silent? Who have you got there dressed up like a Hungarian?� the regimental commander joked sternly.

�Your Excellency��

�Well, �Your Excellency� what? Your Excellency! Your Excellency! But Your Excellency what�nobody knows.�

�Your Excellency, it�s Dolokhov, who was reduced�� the captain said softly.

�What, he�s been reduced to a field marshal, is it, or to a common soldier? If it�s a common soldier, then he should be dressed in the proper uniform like everybody else.�

�Your Excellency, you yourself gave him permission for the march.�

�Permission? Permission? You young people are always that way,� said the regimental commander, cooling down a little. �Permission? Say something to you, and you�� The regimental commander paused. �Say something to you, and you�What?� he said, getting irritated again. �Kindly dress your men properly��

And, having glanced at the adjutant, the regimental commander walked with his bouncing gait towards the regiment. It was clear that he liked his own irritation and that he wanted to walk the length of the regiment and find more pretexts for his wrath. Having snapped at one officer for an unpolished insignia, and another for an unevenness in one rank, he came to the third company.

�Ho-o-ow�s that you�re standing? Where�s your leg? Where�s your leg?� the regimental commander shouted with an expression of suffering in his voice, still five men away from Dolokhov, who was wearing a bluish greatcoat.

Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent leg and looked the general directly in the face with his light and insolent gaze.

�Why a blue greatcoat? Away!�Sergeant major! Have him changed�the dir�� He did not have time to finish.

�General, I am duty-bound to obey orders, but I am not duty-bound to put up with�� Dolokhov said hastily.

�No talking at attention!�No talking, no talking!��

�Not duty-bound to put up with insults,� Dolokhov finished loudly and resoundingly.

The eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general said nothing, angrily pulling down on his tight sash.

�Kindly change, I ask you,� he said, walking away.


II

�He�s coming!� the signalman shouted just then.

The regimental commander, turning red, ran to his horse, took the stirrup in his trembling hands, threw his body over, straightened up, drew his sword, and, with a happy, resolute face, opening his mouth askew, prepared to shout. The regiment fluttered up briefly, like a bird preening itself, and grew still.

�Te-n-n-n-HUT!� shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shattering voice, overjoyed for himself, strict in regard to the regiment, and welcoming in regard to his approaching superior.

Down the wide, tree-lined, unpaved main road, rumbling slightly on its springs, a high, light-blue Viennese coach-and-six came driving at a quick canter. Behind the coach galloped the suite and a convoy of Croats. Beside Kutuzov sat an Austrian general in a white uniform, strange amidst the black Russian ones. The coach drew up by the regiment. Kutuzov and the Austrian general conversed quietly about something, and Kutuzov smiled slightly, at the same time stepping down heavily from the footboard, as if these two thousand men staring at him and at the regimental commander with bated breath did not exist.

A shout of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, jingling, as it presented arms. In the dead silence, the weak voice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment barked: �Long live Your Excellen-cellen-cellency!� And again everything grew still. At first Kutuzov stood in place while the regiment moved; then Kutuzov, with the white general beside him, on foot, followed by his suite, started walking along the ranks.

By the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief, fastening his eyes on him, stretching and drawing himself up; by the way he walked along the ranks behind the generals, his body leaning forward, barely controlling his bouncing movement; by the way he jumped at each word and movement of the commander in chief�one could see that he fulfilled his duties as a subordinate with still greater pleasure than his duties as a superior. Owing to the regimental commander�s strictness and zeal, the regiment was in excellent condition compared with others that had come to Braunau at the same time. The stragglers and sick amounted to only two hundred and seventeen men. And everything was in order, except the footgear.

Kutuzov walked along the ranks, stopping every once in a while and saying a few affectionate words to the officers he knew from the Turkish war, and sometimes to soldiers as well. Looking at the footgear, he several times shook his head sadly and pointed it out to the Austrian general with such an expression as though, while not blaming anyone for it, he could not help seeing how bad it was. The regimental commander ran ahead each time, afraid to miss a word of what the commander in chief said about the regiment. Behind Kutuzov, at a distance from which every faintly uttered word could be heard, walked some twenty men of his suite. The gentlemen of the suite talked among themselves and occasionally laughed. Closest behind the commander in chief walked a handsome officer. This was Prince Bolkonsky. Beside him walked his comrade Nesvitsky, a tall staff officer, extremely fat, with a kind, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes. Nesvitsky could barely hold back his laughter, provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who was walking near him. The hussar officer, without smiling, without changing the expression of his fixed gaze, was staring with a serious face at the regimental commander�s back and mimicking his every movement. Each time the regimental commander bounced and leaned forward, the hussar officer bounced and leaned forward in the same, in exactly the same way. Nesvitsky laughed and nudged the others, urging them to look at the funnyman.

Kutuzov walked slowly and indolently past the thousands of eyes that were popping from their sockets, following the superior. Coming up to the third company, he suddenly stopped. His suite, not foreseeing this stop, inadvertently ran into him.

�Ah, Timokhin!� said the commander in chief, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had suffered on account of the blue greatcoat.

It would seem impossible to draw oneself up more than Timokhin had drawn himself up when the regimental commander reprimanded him. But the moment the commander in chief addressed him, the captain drew himself up so much that it seemed, if the commander in chief were to look at him a little longer, the captain would be unable to stand it; and therefore Kutuzov, evidently understanding his situation, and wishing the captain, on the contrary, nothing but good, hastened to turn away. A barely noticeable smile passed over Kutuzov�s puffy face, disfigured by a wound.

�Another Izmail comrade,� he said. �A brave officer! Are you pleased with him?� Kutuzov asked the regimental commander.

And the regimental commander, reflected as in a mirror, invisibly to himself, in the hussar officer, bounced, came forward, and replied:

�Very pleased, Your Excellency.�

�We all have our weaknesses,� said Kutuzov, smiling and moving away from him. �His was a devotion to Bacchus.�

The regimental commander was afraid that he might be blamed for that and made no reply. Just then the officer noticed the face of the captain with the red nose and drawn-in stomach and mimicked his face and pose so perfectly that Nesvitsky could not keep from laughing. Kutuzov turned around. It was clear that the officer could control his face at will: the moment Kutuzov turned around, the officer managed to make a scowl and then assume a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.

The third company was the last, and Kutuzov fell to thinking, evidently recalling something. Prince Andrei stepped from among the suite and said quietly in French:

�You asked me to remind you about the demoted officer Dolokhov in this regiment.�

�Where�s this Dolokhov?� asked Kutuzov.

Dolokhov, now changed into a gray soldier�s greatcoat, did not wait to be called out. The trim figure of the fair-haired soldier with clear blue eyes stepped from the line. He went up to the commander in chief and presented arms.

�A grievance?� Kutuzov asked, frowning slightly.

�This is Dolokhov,� said Prince Andrei.

�Ah!� said Kutuzov. �I hope this lesson will set you straight. Serve well. Our sovereign is merciful. And I won�t forget you, if you prove worthy.�

The blue, clear eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as at the regimental commander, as if tearing by their expression the curtain of convention that had so widely separated the commander in chief from the soldier.

�I ask only one thing, Your Excellency,� he said in his firm, sonorous, unhurried voice. �I ask to be given a chance to wipe out my guilt and prove my devotion to the sovereign and to Russia.�

Kutuzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes flashed over his face as when he had turned away from Captain Timokhin. He turned away and winced, as if wishing to express thereby that all that Dolokhov had said to him and all that he could say had long, long been known to him, that it all bored him, and that it was all by no means what was needed. He turned away and made for the coach.

The regiment broke up into companies and dispersed to their assigned quarters not far from Braunau, where they hoped to find footgear, mend their clothes, and get some rest after their hard marching.

�Don�t hold it against me, Prokhor Ignatych!� said the regimental commander, circling around the third company, which was moving to its quarters, and riding up to Captain Timokhin, who was walking at the head of it. The face of the regimental commander, after the happily passed-off review, expressed irrepressible joy. �The tsar�s service�impossible�sometimes one gets snappish on parade�I�m the first to apologize, you know me�He was very grateful!� And he held out his hand to the company commander.

�Mercy, General, I wouldn�t be so bold!� replied the captain, his nose reddening, smiling and revealing with his smile the absence of his two front teeth, knocked out by a rifle butt at Izmail.

�And tell Mr. Dolokhov that I won�t forget him, he should rest easy. And tell me, please, I keep forgetting to ask, how is he, how does he behave? And all��

�He�s very correct in his service, Your Excellency�but his charickter�� said Timokhin.

�What, what about his character?� asked the regimental commander.

�It comes over him, Your Excellency, some days,� said the captain. �He�s clever, and learned, and kind. And then he�s a beast. In Poland he all but killed a Jew, if you want to know��

�Well, yes, yes,� said the regimental commander, �still one must pity the young fellow in his misfortune. Big connections�So you just��

�Right, Your Excellency,� said Timokhin, his smile letting it be felt that he understood his superior�s wishes.

�Well, yes, yes.�

The regimental commander sought out Dolokhov in the ranks and reined in his horse.

�With the first action�epaulettes,� he said to him.

Dolokhov looked, said nothing, and did not change the expression of his mockingly smiling mouth.

�Well, that�s fine,� the regimental commander went on. �The men get a glass of vodka each from me,� he added loudly, so that the soldiers could hear. �I�m grateful to you all! Thank God!� And, going ahead of the company, he rode to the next one.

�Why, he�s really a good man, you can serve with him,� Timokhin said to a subaltern officer who was walking beside him.

�All heart, in a word!�� the subaltern officer said, laughing (the regimental commander�s nickname was �the King of Hearts�).

The happy state of mind of the officers after the review passed itself on to the soldiers. The company walked along merrily. On all sides soldiers� voices exchanged remarks.

�How come they said Kutuzov was blind in one eye?�

�Hell he�s not! Stone blind��

�Naw�brother, he�s sharper-eyed than you�the boots and the foot cloths, he took it all in��

�The way he looked my feet over, dear brother mine�Well! I think��

�And that other one, the Austriak with him, it�s like he�s all smeared with chalk. White as flour! I s�pose they clean him like ammunition!�

�What about it, Fedeshou!�Did he say when the fighting would begin? You were standing closer. They all said Boonapart himself was stationed in Brunovo.�

�Boonapart stationed there! Lies, you fool! What do you know! It�s the Prussky�s up in arms now. The Austriak�s pacifying him. Soon as they make peace, the war with Boonapart will open up. And he says Boonapart�s in Brunovo! It�s plain you�re a fool, no point listening to you.�

�Devilish billeters! The fifth company�s already tucked into the village, see, they�ll have their kasha boiled, and we�ve still got no place.�

�Give us a biscuit, you devil.�

�And did you give me tobacco yesterday? So there, brother. Well, here, take it, God help you.�

�They could at least call a halt, or else we�ll slog on for three more miles unfed.�

�It was a pretty thing the way the Germans sent us carriages. You go riding along, you know: it�s grand!�

�But here, brother, the folk have gone clean wild. There it was all some kind of Poles, all under the Russian crown, but now, brother, it�s gone solid German.�

�Singers, up front!� the captain�s shout was heard.

And some twenty men from various ranks ran to the front of the company. The drummer and lead singer turned to face the singers, waved his arm, and struck up a drawn-out soldiers� song that began: �It was dawn, the sun was rising�� and ended with the words: �And that, brothers, will our glory be with old man Kamensky�� The song had been composed in Turkey, and was now being sung in Austria, only with one change, that instead of �old man Kamensky,� they put in �old man Kutuzov.�

Having snapped out these last words in soldierly fashion and waved his arms as if throwing something on the ground, the drummer, a lean and handsome soldier of about forty, sternly looked the soldier-singers over and narrowed his eyes. Then, making sure that all eyes were aimed at him, he raised his arms as if carefully lifting some invisible precious object over his head, held it there for a few seconds, and all at once desperately threw it down:

Ah, my porch, my new porch!

�Ah, my new porch�� twenty voices picked up, and a spoon player, despite the weight of his ammunition, nimbly leaped out in front and walked backwards facing the company, moving his shoulders and threatening someone with his spoons. The soldiers swung their arms in time with the song, striding freely along and involuntarily keeping in step. From behind the company came the sound of wheels, the creaking springs, and the tramping of horses. Kutuzov and his suite were returning to town. The commander in chief gave a sign for the men to go on marching freely, and his face and all the faces of his suite expressed pleasure at the sounds of the song, at the sight of the dancing soldier and the merrily and briskly marching soldiers. In the second row of the right flank, where the coach overtook the company, the eye was involuntarily struck by the blue-eyed soldier Dolokhov, who marched especially briskly and gracefully in time with the song and looked at the faces of people passing by with such an expression as if he pitied all those who were not then marching with the company. The hussar cornet from Kutuzov�s suite, who had been mimicking the regimental commander, dropped behind the coach and rode over to Dolokhov.

The hussar cornet Zherkov had belonged for some time to the rowdy company headed by Dolokhov in Petersburg. Abroad, Zherkov had encountered Dolokhov as a soldier, but had found it unnecessary to recognize him. Now, after Kutuzov had talked with the demoted man, he addressed him with the joy of an old friend.

�Friend of my heart, how are you?� he said to the sounds of the song, adjusting the pace of his horse to the pace of the company.

�How am I?� Dolokhov replied coldly. �As you see.�

The brisk song gave a special meaning to the tone of casual merriment with which Zherkov spoke, and to the intentional coldness of Dolokhov�s replies.

�Well, how are you getting along with your superiors?� asked Zherkov.

�Well enough, they�re good people. How did you manage to turn up on the staff?�

�By appointment. I�m on duty.�

They fell silent.

�She let the falcon go, from her right sleeve let it go,� said the song, involuntarily arousing a cheerful, merry feeling. Their conversation would probably have been different, if they had not been talking to the sounds of the song.

�So, is it true the Austrians have been beaten?� asked Dolokhov.

�Devil knows, they say so.�

�I�m glad,� Dolokhov replied briefly and clearly, as the song required.

�So, then, come over some evening, we�ll set up a game of faro,� said Zherkov.

�What, have you got a lot of money?�

�Come over.�

�Impossible. I�ve sworn off it. No drinking and no gambling, until I�ve been promoted.�

�So, then, till the first action��

�We�ll see��

They again fell silent.

�Just come, if you need something, the staff can always be helpful�� said Zherkov.

Dolokhov grinned.

�You�d best not worry. If I need anything, I won�t ask, I�ll take it myself.�

�So, then, I just��

�Well, and I, too, just��

�Good-bye.�

�Be well��


�And high and far he flew

To his own native land�


Zherkov touched his horse with his spurs; it shifted its footing three times excitedly, not knowing which leg to start with, worked it out, and galloped off, going ahead of the company and catching up with the coach, also in time with the song.


III

On returning from the review, Kutuzov, accompanied by the Austrian general, went to his office and, calling his adjutant, told him to bring him certain papers pertaining to the condition of the arriving troops and letters from Archduke Ferdinand, who was heading the army of the vanguard. Prince Andrei Bolkonsky came into the commander in chief�s office with the requested papers. Kutuzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were sitting over a map spread out on the table.

�Ah�� said Kutuzov, glancing at Bolkonsky, as if with this word he was inviting the adjutant to wait, and went on with the conversation begun in French.

�I�m saying only one thing, General,� Kutuzov said with a pleasant graciousness of expression and intonation, which made one listen well to every unhurriedly uttered word. It could be seen that Kutuzov, too, listened to himself with pleasure. �I�m only saying one thing, General, that if the matter depended on my own personal wish, the will of his majesty the emperor Franz would have been fulfilled long ago. I would long ago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honor, for me personally to hand over the supreme command of the army to a more knowledgeable and skillful general, such as Austria abounds in, and to lay down all this heavy responsibility, for me personally it would be a delight. But circumstances are sometimes stronger than we are, General.�

And Kutuzov smiled with such an expression as if he was saying: �You have every right not to believe me, and I�m even quite indifferent to whether you believe me or not, but you have no cause for telling me so. And that�s the whole point.�

The Austrian general had a displeased look, but he had no choice but to answer Kutuzov in the same tone.

�On the contrary,� he said in a peevish and angry tone, quite contradictory to the flattering meaning of the words he spoke, �on the contrary, Your Excellency�s participation in the common cause is highly appreciated by his majesty; but we think that the present delay is depriving the valiant Russian army and its commanders of the laurels they are accustomed to reap in battle,� he finished an obviously prepared phrase.

Kutuzov bowed with an unchanging smile.

�But I am convinced and, basing myself on the last letter with which his highness Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I suppose that the Austrian troops under the command of so skillful a leader as General Mack, have now gained a decisive victory and are no longer in need of our help,� said Kutuzov.

The general frowned. Though there was no positive news about the defeat of the Austrians, there were far too many circumstances confirming the general unfavorable rumors; and therefore Kutuzov�s supposition about an Austrian victory looked very much like mockery. But Kutuzov was smiling meekly, with the same expression which said that he had the right to suppose so. In fact, the last letter he had had from Mack�s army had informed him of the victory and of the most advantageous strategic position of the army.

�Give me that letter,� said Kutuzov, turning to Prince Andrei. �Take a look, if you please,� and Kutuzov, with a mocking smile at the corners of his lips, read in German for the Austrian general the following passage from the letter of Archduke Ferdinand:

Wir haben vollkommen zusammengehaltene Kr&#228;fte, nahe an 70,000 Mann, um den Feind, wenn er den Lech passierte, angreifen und schlagen zu k&#246;nnen. Wir k&#246;nnen, da wir Meister von Ulm sind, den Vorteil, auch von beiden Ufern der Donau Meister zu bleiben, nicht verlieren; mithin auch jeden Augenblick, wenn der Feind den Lech nicht passierte, die Donau &#252;bersetzen, uns auf seine Kommunications-Linie werfen, die Donau unterhalb repassieren und dem Feinde, wenn er sich gegen unsere treue Allierte mit ganzer Macht wenden wollte, seine Absicht alsbald vereiteln. Wir werden auf solche Weise dem Zeitpunkt, wo die Kaiserlich-Russische Arm&#233;e ausger&#252;stet sein wird, mutig entgegenharren, und sodann leicht gemeinshaftlich die M&#246;glichkeit finden, dem Feinde das Schicksal zuzubereiten, so er verdient.

Kutuzov sighed deeply as he finished this paragraph and looked at the member of the Hofkriegsrath attentively and benignly.

�But Your Excellency knows the wise rule which prescribes that one should assume the worst,� said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to put an end to the joking and get down to business.

He glanced with displeasure at the adjutant.

�Excuse me, General,� Kutuzov interrupted him and also turned to Prince Andrei. �I tell you what, my gentle, you get all the reports our scouts have received from Kozlovsky. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz, here is the letter from his highness Archduke Ferdinand, here are some others,� he said, handing him several papers. �And from all this compose a clear memorandum, in French, presenting all the news we�ve had about the actions of the Austrian army. Well, do that, and give it to his excellency.�

Prince Andrei inclined his head to indicate that he had understood from the first word not only what had been said, but also what Kutuzov had wished to tell him. He gathered up the papers and, making a general bow, stepping softly over the carpet, went out to the waiting room.

Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrei left Russia, he had changed much during that time. In the expression of his face, in his movements, in his gait there was almost no trace of the former affectation, fatigue, and laziness; he had the look of a man who had no time to think of the impression he made on others and who was occupied with pleasant and interesting things. His face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him; his smile and glance were more cheerful and attractive.

Kutuzov, whom he had overtaken still in Poland, had received him very affectionately, promised not to forget him, distinguished him from the other adjutants, taken him along to Vienna, charged him with more serious missions. From Vienna Kutuzov wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrei�s father.

�Your son,� he wrote, �promises to become an outstanding officer, by his knowledge, firmness, and industry. I consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate at hand.�

On Kutuzov�s staff, among his comrades and colleagues, and in the army in general, as in Petersburg society, Prince Andrei had two completely opposite reputations. Some, the smaller part, considered Prince Andrei to be something distinct from themselves and from all others, expected great success from him, listened to him, admired him, and imitated him; and with these people Prince Andrei was simple and pleasant. Others, the majority, did not like Prince Andrei, considering him a pompous, cold, and unpleasant man. But with these people Prince Andrei was able to behave in such a way as to be respected and even feared.

Coming out to the waiting room from Kutuzov�s office, Prince Andrei, holding the papers, went up to his colleague on duty, the adjutant Kozlovsky, who was sitting by the window with a book.

�Well, what is it, Prince?� asked Kozlovsky.

�I�ve been ordered to compose a memorandum explaining why we are not moving forward.�

�And why is it?�

Prince Andrei shrugged his shoulders.

�Any news from Mack?� asked Kozlovsky.

�No.�

�If it were true that he�s been defeated, the news would have come.�

�Probably,� said Prince Andrei and headed for the front door; but just then the door slammed and a tall Austrian general, evidently just arrived, in a frock coat, his head bound in a black bandage and the order of Maria Theresa on his neck, quickly entered the waiting room. Prince Andrei stopped.

�General in Chief Kutuzov?� the just-arrived general spoke quickly, with a strong German accent, glancing to both sides and going to the door of the office without pausing.

�The general in chief is busy,� said Kozlovsky, hastily going up to the unknown general and barring his way to the door. �How shall I announce you?�

The unknown general looked down scornfully at the short Kozlovsky, as if surprised that there could be people who did not know him.

�The general in chief is busy,� Kozlovsky calmly repeated.

The general�s face frowned, his lips twitched and trembled. He took out a notebook, quickly jotted something with a pencil, tore out the page, handed it over, went with quick steps to the window, dropped his body into a chair, and looked around at those who were in the room, as if asking why they were looking at him. Then the general raised his head, stretched his neck, as if intending to say something, but at once, as if casually beginning to hum to himself, produced a strange sound, which at once broke off. The door to the office opened, and Kutuzov appeared on the threshold. The general with the bandaged head, leaning forward as if fleeing from danger, went up to Kutuzov with long, rapid strides of his thin legs.

�Vous voyez le malheureux Mack,� he uttered in a breaking voice.

The face of Kutuzov, who was standing in the doorway of his office, remained perfectly immobile for a few moments. Then a wrinkle passed like a wave over his face, his brow became smooth again, he inclined his head deferentially, closed his eyes, silently allowed Mack to pass, followed him in, and closed the door behind him.

The rumor that had already spread earlier about the defeat of the Austrians and the surrender of the entire army at Ulm turned out to be true. Within half an hour adjutants had been sent out in various directions with orders demonstrating that the Russian troops, so far inactive, would soon also have to meet the enemy.

Prince Andrei was one of the rare officers on the staff who placed his main interest in the general course of military operations. Seeing Mack and hearing the details of his ruin, he understood that half the campaign was lost, understood all the difficulty of the Russian troops� position, and vividly pictured to himself what awaited the army, and the role he was to play in it. Involuntarily, he experienced an excited, joyful feeling at the thought of the disgrace of self-confident Austria and of the fact that in a week, perhaps, he would have to see and take part in the encounter of the Russians with the French, the first since Suvorov. But he feared the genius of Bonaparte, which might prove stronger than all the courage of the Russian troops, and at the same time he could not allow for the disgrace of his hero.

Excited and irritated by these thoughts, Prince Andrei went to his room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the corridor he met his roommate Nesvitsky and the joker Zherkov; they were laughing at something, as usual.

�Why so glum?� asked Nesvitsky, noticing Prince Andrei�s pale face with its glittering eyes.

�There�s nothing to be merry about,� replied Bolkonsky.

Just as Prince Andrei met Nesvitsky and Zherkov, the Austrian general Strauch, attached to Kutuzov�s staff to oversee the supplying of the Russian army, came from the other end of the corridor, along with the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the day before. The corridor was wide enough for the generals to pass the three officers unhindered, but Zherkov, pushing Nesvitsky aside with his hand, said in a breathless voice:

�They�re coming!�they�re coming!�step aside, make way, make way, please.�

The generals came on, looking as if they could do without embarrassing honors. The face of the joker Zherkov suddenly showed a stupid smile of joy, which he seemed unable to suppress.

�Your Excellency,� he said in German, stepping forward and addressing the Austrian general, �I have the honor to congratulate you.�

He bowed his head and began scraping with one foot, then the other, awkwardly, like children who are learning to dance.

The general who was a member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him sternly; but, noticing the seriousness of the stupid smile, could not refuse it a moment�s attention. He narrowed his eyes, showing that he was listening.

�I have the honor to congratulate you: General Mack has arrived in good health, except for a slight wound here,� he added with a beaming smile, pointing to his head.

The general frowned, turned away, and walked on.

�Gott, wie naiv!� he said angrily after going a few steps.

Nesvitsky, guffawing, put his arm around Prince Andrei, but Bolkonsky, turning still more pale, with an angry expression on his face, pushed him away and turned to Zherkov. The nervous irritation he had felt at the sight of Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what awaited the Russian army now found its outlet in his anger at Zherkov�s inappropriate joke.

�If you, my dear sir,� he began in a shrill voice, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, �wish to be a buffoon, I cannot prevent you from being one; but I announce to you that the next time you dare to clown in my presence, I will teach you how to behave.�

Nesvitsky and Zherkov were so astounded by this outburst that they silently stared wide-eyed at Bolkonsky.

�Why, I only congratulated him,� said Zherkov.

�I am not joking with you, kindly keep silent!� shouted Bolkonsky, and, taking Nesvitsky by the arm, he walked away from Zherkov, who was at a loss how to reply.

�Well, what�s with you, brother?� Nesvitsky said peaceably.

�What�s with me?� said Prince Andrei, stopping in agitation. �Understand that we�re either officers serving our tsar and fatherland, and rejoice in our common successes and grieve over our common failures, or we�re lackeys, who have nothing to do with their masters� doings. Quarante mille hommes massacr&#233;s et l�arm&#233;e de nos alli&#233;s d&#233;truite, et vous trouvez l&#224; le mot pour rire,� he said, as if clinching his opinion by this French phrase. �C�est bien pour un gar&#231;on de rien, comme cette individu, dont vous avez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas pour vous. Only schoolboys can have fun like that,� Prince Andrei added in Russian, pronouncing the word with a French accent, noticing that Zherkov was still within earshot.

He waited for the cornet to make some reply. But the cornet turned and left the corridor.


IV

The Pavlogradsky hussar regiment was stationed two miles from Braunau. The squadron in which Nikolai Rostov served as a junker had settled in the German village of Salzeneck. The squadron commander, Captain Denisov, known to the whole cavalry division as Vaska Denisov, was assigned the best quarters in the village. Junker Rostov had been living with the squadron commander ever since he caught up with his regiment in Poland.

On October 8th, the day when at headquarters all were brought to their feet by the news of Mack�s defeat, in the squadron staff life quietly went on as before. Denisov, who had spent the whole night playing cards, was still not home when Rostov, on horseback, came back from foraging early in the morning. Rostov, in his junker�s uniform, rode up to the porch, nudged his horse around, swung his leg over him in a supple, youthful movement, stood in the stirrup as if not wishing to part with his horse, finally jumped down, and shouted for the orderly.

�Ah, Bondarenko, friend of my heart,� he said to the hussar who came rushing for his horse. �Give him a cooling down, my friend,� he said with that merry brotherly tenderness with which all fine young men treat everyone when they are happy.

�Yes, Your Excellency,� the Ukrainian replied, merrily shaking his head.

�See that you give him a good cooling down!�

Another hussar also rushed to the horse, but Bondarenko had already thrown the reins over the horse�s head. One could see that the junker gave good tips and it was profitable to be of service to him. Rostov stroked the horse�s neck, then his croup, and stopped on the porch.

�Very nice! What a horse he�ll be!� he said to himself and, smiling and holding his saber, ran up the steps, his spurs jingling. The German landlord, in a vest and a cap, holding the fork he was using to clear away dung, peeked out of the cowshed. As soon as he saw Rostov, the German�s face suddenly brightened. He smiled merrily and winked: �Sch&#246;n, gut Morgen! Sch&#246;n, gut Morgen!� he repeated, obviously taking pleasure in greeting the young man.

�Schon fleissig!� said Rostov, still with the same joyful, brotherly smile, which never left his animated face. �Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! Kaiser Alexander hoch!� he addressed the German, repeating words often spoken by the landlord.

The German laughed, came all the way out of the cowshed door, pulled off his cap, and, waving it above his head, cried:

�Und die ganze Welt hoch!�

Rostov himself, like the German, waved his peaked cap above his head and, laughing, shouted: �Und vivat die ganze Welt!� Though there was no particular reason for rejoicing either for the German, who was cleaning his cowshed, or for Rostov, who had gone for hay with his section, the two men looked at each other with happy delight and brotherly love, shook their heads as a sign of mutual love, and, smiling, went their way�the German to the cowshed, and Rostov to the cottage he occupied with Denisov.

�How�s the master?� he asked Lavrushka, Denisov�s lackey, a rogue known to the whole regiment.

�Hasn�t been back since evening. Must�ve lost,� replied Lavrushka. �I know for sure, if he wins, he comes early so as to boast, but if he stays away till morning, it means he blew it�and he�ll come angry. Shall I serve coffee?�

�Go on, go on.�

Ten minutes later Lavrushka brought coffee.

�He�s coming,� he said. �Now for trouble.�

Rostov looked out the window and saw Denisov coming home. Denisov was a small man with a red face, shining black eyes, and disheveled black mustaches and hair. He was wearing an unbuttoned dolman, wide pleated trousers ballooning over his boots, and a crumpled hussar cap perched on the back of his head. He was approaching the porch gloomily, his head hanging.

�Lavrushka,� he shouted loudly and crossly. �Well, take it off, blockhead!�

�I am taking it off,� Lavrushka�s voice replied.

�Ah! you�re up already,� said Denisov, going into the room.

�Long ago,� said Rostov. �I already went for hay and saw Fr&#228;ulein Mathilde.�

�Ah, really! And I blew everything last night, brother, like a son of a bitch!� shouted Denisov, swallowing his r�s. �Such bad luck! Such bad luck!�As soon as you left, it started. Hey, tea!�

Denisov, wincing as if he was smiling and baring his short, strong teeth, began tousling his forest-thick, tangled, bushy black hair with both short-fingered hands.

�The devil prompted me to go to that rat� (the officer�s nickname was �the Rat�), he said, rubbing his forehead and face with both hands. �Can you imagine, not a single good card, not one.�

Denisov took the lighted pipe served to him, clutched it in his fist, banged it on the floor, spraying sparks, and went on shouting:

�He gives you the simple, and beats it with the paroli; gives you the simple, and beats it with the paroli.�

He spilled the fire, smashed the pipe, and threw it away. Then he paused and suddenly glanced merrily at Rostov with his shining black eyes.

�If only there were some women. But here, except for drinking, there�s nothing to do. If only we�d start fighting soon�Hey, who�s there?� he turned to the door, hearing the tread of heavy boots with jingling spurs come to a stop and then a respectful cough.

�The sergeant major!� said Lavrushka.

Denisov winced still more.

�Rotten luck,� he said, throwing down a purse with a few gold pieces. �Rostov, dear heart, count up what�s left and put it under the pillow,� he said and went out to the sergeant major.

Rostov took the money and, mechanically sorting the old and new coins into separate piles, began counting it.

�Ah! Telyanin! Greetings! I blew everything last night,� Denisov�s voice came from the other room.

�Where? At Bykov�s, at the Rat�s?�I knew it,� said a high-pitched voice, and after that Lieutenant Telyanin, a small officer from the same squadron, came in.

Rostov threw the purse under the pillow and shook the small, moist hand that was held out to him. Telyanin had for some reason been transferred from the guards just before the campaign. He behaved very well in the regiment; but he was not liked, and Rostov especially could neither overcome nor conceal his causeless loathing for the man.

�Well, so, young cavalryman, how�s my Little Rook serving you?� he asked. (Little Rook was a saddle horse, recently broken, that Telyanin had sold to Rostov.)

The lieutenant never looked the person he was talking to in the eye; his eyes constantly shifted from one object to another.

�I saw you ride by today��

�He�s all right, a good horse,� replied Rostov, although the horse, which he had bought for seven hundred rubles, was not worth even half that price. �He�s begun to favor the left foreleg�� he added.

�The hoof�s cracked! It�s nothing. I�ll teach you, I�ll show you what sort of clinch nail to put on it.�

�Yes, please show me,� said Rostov.

�I will, I will, it�s no secret. And you�ll be thankful for the horse.�

�I�ll have the horse brought, then,� said Rostov, wishing to be rid of Telyanin, and he went to give orders for the horse to be brought.

In the front hall, Denisov, crouching on the threshold with his pipe, sat facing the sergeant major, who was reporting something. Seeing Rostov, Denisov winced and pointed over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting, winced again, and shuddered with loathing.

�Ach, I dislike the fellow,� he said, unembarrassed by the sergeant major�s presence.

Rostov shrugged his shoulders, as if to say, �So do I, but what to do!� and, having given orders, went back to Telyanin.

Telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostov had left him, rubbing his small white hands.

�There are such repulsive faces in the world,� thought Rostov, going into the room.

�So, did you order the horse brought?� asked Telyanin, getting up and glancing around casually.

�I did.�

�Well, come on then. I only stopped to ask Denisov about yesterday�s orders. Did you receive them, Denisov?�

�Not yet. And where are you going?�

�I want to teach the young man how to shoe a horse.�

They went out to the porch and to the stable. The lieutenant showed him how to do a clinch nail, and went home.

When Rostov came back, there was a bottle of vodka and some sausage on the table. Denisov was sitting at the table scratching on a piece of paper with his quill. He glanced darkly at Rostov�s face.

�I�m writing to her,� he said.

He leaned his elbow on the table, the quill in his hand, and, obviously glad of the chance to quickly speak out everything he wanted to write, began reciting his letter to Rostov.

�You see, friend,� he said, �we�re asleep until we love. We�re children of dust�but fall in love�and you�re God, you�re pure as on the first day of creation�Who�s that now? Send him to the devil. No time!� he shouted to Lavrushka, who came up to him without the slightest timidity.

�Who is it? You gave the order yourself. The sergeant major�s come for money.�

Denisov winced, was about to shout something, but kept silent.

�Rotten business,� he said to himself. �How much money was left in the purse?� he asked Rostov.

�Seven new and three old.�

�Ah, rot! Well, what are you standing there for, scarecrow, off to the sergeant major,� Denisov shouted at Lavrushka.

�Please, Denisov, take money from me, I�ve got it,� Rostov said, blushing.

�I don�t like getting friends involved, no, I don�t,� Denisov muttered.

�If you won�t take money from me as a friend, you�ll offend me. I really have got it,� Rostov repeated.

�No, no, I won�t.�

And Denisov went to the bed to take his purse from under the pillow.

�Where�d you put it, Rostov?�

�Under the bottom pillow.�

�It�s not there.�

Denisov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.

�That�s odd!�

�Wait, maybe you dropped it?� said Rostov, picking up first one pillow, then the other, and shaking them.

He tore off the blanket and shook it. The purse was not there.

�Maybe I forgot? No, I thought then that it was as if you were hiding a treasure under your head,� said Rostov. �I put the purse there. Where is it?� he turned to Lavrushka.

�I didn�t come in. It should be wherever you put it.�

�But it�s not.�

�It�s always that way, you toss something somewhere and then forget. Look in your pockets.�

�No, maybe if I hadn�t thought about the treasure,� said Rostov, �but I remember putting it there.�

Lavrushka rummaged through the whole bed, looked under it, looked under the table, rummaged about everywhere, and stopped in the middle of the room. Denisov silently followed Lavrushka�s movements, and when Lavrushka spread his arms in surprise, saying it was not to be found anywhere, he looked at Rostov.

�Rostov, you�re not a prankst��

Rostov felt Denisov�s gaze on him, raised his eyes, and instantly lowered them. All the blood he had locked up somewhere under his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could scarcely breathe.

�There was nobody in the room except the lieutenant and you. It�s here somewhere,� said Lavrushka.

�Ah, you devil�s puppet, stir your stumps, get looking,� Denisov shouted suddenly, turning purple and hurling himself at the lackey with a menacing gesture. �There�ll be a purse, or I�ll flog you to death. I�ll flog you all to death!�

Rostov, avoiding Denisov�s eyes, began to button his jacket, buckled on his saber, and put on his peaked cap.

�I tell you, there�ll be a purse,� Denisov shouted, shaking the orderly by the shoulder and pushing him against the wall.

�Denisov, leave him alone; I know who took it,� said Rostov, approaching the door and not raising his eyes.

Denisov paused, reflected, and, evidently realizing what Rostov was alluding to, seized his arm.

�Rubbish!� he shouted so that the veins swelled like ropes on his neck and forehead. �You�ve lost your mind, I tell you, I won�t stand for it. The purse is here; I�ll skin this scoundrel alive, and it will be here.�

�I know who took it,� Rostov repeated in a trembling voice, going to the door.

�And I tell you, don�t you dare do that,� cried Denisov, rushing at the junker to hold him back.

But Rostov tore his arm free and, with as much spite as if Denisov was his greatest enemy, directly and firmly fixed his eyes on him.

�Do you realize what you�re saying?� he said in a trembling voice. �Besides me, there was no one else in the room. Which means, if that�s not it, then��

He was unable to finish and ran out of the room.

�Ah, the devil take you and all the rest of them� were the last words Rostov heard.

Rostov went to Telyanin�s quarters.

�The master�s not at home, he�s gone to the staff,� Telyanin�s orderly told him. �Has something happened?� the orderly added, surprised to see the junker�s upset face.

�No, nothing.�

�You just missed him,� said the orderly.

The staff was quartered two miles from Salzeneck. Without stopping at home, Rostov took his horse and rode to the staff. In the village occupied by the staff there was a tavern frequented by the officers. Rostov rode to the tavern; near the porch he saw Telyanin�s horse.

The lieutenant was sitting in the second room of the tavern over a plate of sausage and a bottle of wine.

�Ah, you�ve come, too, young man,� he said, smiling and raising his eyebrows high.

�Yes,� said Rostov, as if it cost him great effort to utter this word, and sat at the next table.

Both were silent; there were two Germans in the room and a Russian officer. Everyone was silent, and only the clank of knives against plates was heard and the lieutenant�s chomping. When Telyanin finished his lunch, he took a double purse from his pocket, opened the clasp with his small, white, upturned fingers, took out a gold coin and, raising his eyebrows, gave it to the waiter.

�Make it quick, please,� he said.

The coin was a new one. Rostov got up and went over to Telyanin.

�May I look at your purse?� he said in a low, barely audible voice.

With shifty eyes, but still raising his eyebrows, Telyanin handed him the purse.

�Yes, a pretty purse�Yes�yes�� he said and suddenly turned pale. �Have a look, young man,� he added.

Rostov took the purse in his hands and looked at it, and at the money that was in it, and at Telyanin. The lieutenant glanced about, as was his habit, and suddenly seemed to become very merry.

�If we get to Vienna, I�ll leave it all there, but there�s nothing to do with it in these trashy little towns,� he said. �Well, young man, give it to me, I�m leaving.�

Rostov was silent.

�And why are you here? Also to have lunch? The food�s quite good,� Telyanin went on. �Give it to me.�

He reached out and put his hand on the purse. Rostov let go of it. Telyanin took the purse and began to lower it into the pocket of his riding breeches, his eyebrows raised casually, and his mouth slightly open, as if he was saying: �Yes, yes, I�m putting my purse in my pocket, and it�s quite simple, and it�s nobody�s business.�

�Well, then, young man?� he said, sighing and looking into Rostov�s eyes from under his raised eyebrows. Some sort of light, quick as an electric spark, passed from Telyanin�s eyes to the eyes of Rostov and back, and forth and back again, all in an instant.

�Come here,� said Rostov, seizing Telyanin by the arm. He almost dragged him to the window. �That�s Denisov�s money, you took it�� he whispered in his ear.

�What?�What?�How dare you? What?�� said Telyanin.

But these words sounded like a pitiful, desperate cry and a plea for forgiveness. As soon as Rostov heard the sound of that voice, a huge burden of doubt fell from his soul. He felt joy and in the same instant also pity for the wretched man standing before him; but he had to bring the matter he had begun to a conclusion.

�God knows what the people here may think,� Telyanin murmured, seizing his peaked cap and going into a small empty room, �we must have a talk��

�I know it and I�ll prove it,� said Rostov.

�I��

Every muscle in Telyanin�s frightened, pale face began to quiver; his eyes shifted as before, but somewhere low down, not rising to Rostov�s face, and there was a sound of sobbing.

�Count!�don�t ruin�a young man�here�s this wretched�money, take it�� He threw it on the table. �I have an old father, a mother!��

Rostov took the money, avoiding Telyanin�s eyes, and, not saying a word, started out of the room. But at the door he stopped and came back.

�My God,� he said, with tears in his eyes, �how could you have done it?�

�Count�� said Telyanin, going up to the junker.

�Don�t touch me,� said Rostov, drawing back. �If you need the money, take it.� He flung the purse at him and ran out of the tavern.


V

On the evening of the same day, an animated conversation was going on among the squadron officers in Denisov�s quarters.

�And I tell you, Rostov, that you�ve got to apologize to the regimental commander,� said a tall staff captain with grizzled hair, enormous mustaches, and a large-featured, wrinkled face, to the crimson-faced, excited Rostov.

Staff Captain Kirsten had twice been broken to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice won back his commission.

�I won�t allow anyone to call me a liar!� cried Rostov. �He called me a liar, and I called him a liar. Let it remain at that. He can assign me to duty every day, or put me under arrest, but no one will make me apologize, because if he, as the regimental commander, considers it beneath him to give me satisfaction, then��

�Wait a minute, my dear boy, listen to me,� the staff captain interrupted in his bass voice, calmly stroking his long mustache. �You tell the regimental commander, in front of other officers, that an officer has stolen��

�It�s not my fault that the conversation started in front of other officers. Maybe I shouldn�t have spoken in front of them, but I�m no diplomat. I joined the hussars because I thought there was no need for subtleties here, but he calls me a liar�so let him give me satisfaction��

�That�s all well and good, nobody thinks you�re a coward, but that�s not the point. Ask Denisov what it looks like if a junker demands satisfaction from a regimental commander.�

Denisov, chewing his mustache, was listening to the conversation with a gloomy air, apparently unwilling to enter into it. To the staff captain�s question he shook his head negatively.

�You tell the regimental commander about this muck in front of officers,� the staff captain went on. �Bogdanych� (the regimental commander was known as Bogdanych) �brings you up short.�

�He didn�t bring me up short, he said I wasn�t telling the truth.�

�Well, yes, and you said a heap of foolish things to him, and you�ve got to apologize.�

�Not for anything!� cried Rostov.

�I wouldn�t have thought it of you,� the staff captain said gravely and sternly. �You don�t want to apologize, but you, my dear boy, are to blame all around, not only before him, but before the whole regiment, before us all. And here�s how: you might have reflected and taken advice on how to handle this matter, but you blurted it right out, and in front of officers. What�s the regimental commander to do now? Should he prosecute the officer and besmirch the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel? Is that your view of it? Well, it�s not ours. And Bogdanych is a fine fellow for saying you weren�t telling the truth. It�s unpleasant, but what�s to be done, my dear boy, you asked for it. And now, when the affair should be hushed up, out of some sort of cockiness you refuse to apologize, but want to have it all out. It offends you that you have to go on duty, but what is it for you to apologize to an old and honorable officer! Whatever Bogdanych may have done, he is, after all, an honorable and brave old colonel�and yet you�re offended, and to besmirch the whole regiment is nothing to you!� The staff captain�s voice began to tremble. �You, my dear boy, have been with the regiment next to no time; here today, tomorrow somewhere else as a little adjutant; you couldn�t care less if people say: �There are thieves among the Pavlogradsky officers!� But it�s not all the same to us. Isn�t that right, Denisov? It�s not all the same?�

Denisov still kept silent and did not stir, glancing at Rostov from time to time with his shining black eyes.

�Your cockiness is dear to you, you don�t feel like apologizing,� the staff captain went on, �but for us old-timers, since we�ve grown up and, God willing, will die serving in the regiment, the honor of the regiment is dear to us, and Bogdanych knows it. Oh, how dear it is! And this is not good, not good. Whether it offends you or not, I always speak the plain truth. It�s not good!�

And the staff captain got up and turned away from Rostov.

�True, devil take it!� shouted Denisov, jumping up. �Well, so, Rostov!�

Rostov, blushing and paling, looked now at the one, now at the other officer.

�No, gentlemen, no�don�t think�I understand very well, you�re wrong to think it of me�I�for me�for the honor of the regiment�well, so? I�ll show it by my deeds, and for me the honor of the flag�Well, anyhow, it�s true, I�m to blame!�� Tears welled up in his eyes. �I�m to blame, I�m to blame all around! Well, what more do you want?��

�That�s the way, Count!� the staff captain cried, turning and slapping him on the shoulder with his big hand.

�It�s true what I told you,� shouted Denisov, �he�s a good lad!�

�That�s better, Count!� the staff captain repeated, as if beginning to call him by his title on account of his acknowledgment. �Go and apologize, Your Excellency, yes, sir.�

�Gentlemen, I�ll do anything, nobody will hear a word from me,� Rostov said in a pleading voice, �but apologize I cannot, by God, I cannot, do what you will! How am I going to apologize, like a little boy asking forgiveness?�

Denisov laughed.

�So much the worse for you. Bogdanych is rancorous, you�ll pay for your stubbornness,� said Kirsten.

�By God, it�s not stubbornness! I can�t describe the feeling to you, I can�t��

�Well, as you will,� said the staff captain. �So, what�s become of the blackguard now?� he asked Denisov.

�He�s reported himself sick, as of tomorrow he�s been ordered struck off,� said Denisov.

�It�s a sickness, there�s no other explanation,� said the staff captain.

�Sickness or no sickness, he�d better not show his face to me�I�ll kill him!� Denisov shouted out bloodthirstily.

Zherkov came into the room.

�What brings you here?� the officers suddenly addressed the newcomer.

�On the march, gentlemen. Mack has surrendered and his whole army with him.�

�No!�

�I saw him myself.�

�What? Saw Mack alive? with all his arms and legs?�

�On the march! On the march! Give him a bottle for such news. How did you wind up here?�

�I�ve been sent back to the regiment again on account of this devil, this Mack. An Austrian general made a complaint. I congratulated him on Mack�s arrival�What�s with you, Rostov, come straight from the bathhouse?�

�We�ve had a mess brewing here, brother, for two days now.�

A regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by Zherkov. The orders were to set out the next day.

�On the march, gentlemen!�

�Well, thank God, we�ve sat enough.�


VI

Kutuzov fell back towards Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers Inn (in Braunau) and Traun (in Linz). On the twenty-third of October, the Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday Russian transport, artillery, and troop columns were strung out through the town of Enns, on both sides of the bridge.

The day was warm, autumnal, and rainy. The vast prospect that opened out from the height where the Russian batteries stood, defending the bridge, was now suddenly covered by a muslin curtain of slanting rain, then suddenly widened out, and in the sunlight objects became visible and clear in the distance, as if freshly varnished. At one�s feet one could see the little town with its white houses and red roofs, the cathedral, and the bridge, on both sides of which streamed crowding masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube one could see boats and an island, and a castle with a park, surrounded by the waters of the Enns falling into the Danube; one could see the left bank of the Danube, rocky and covered with pine forest, with a mysterious distance of green treetops and bluish gorges. One could see the towers of a convent looming up from the pine forest with its wild and untouched look, and far away on a hilltop, on the other side of the Enns, one could see the mounted patrols of the enemy.

Amidst the cannons on the height, the general in charge of the rear guard stood out in front with an officer of the suite, examining the area through a spyglass. Slightly behind him on the trail of a cannon sat Nesvitsky, sent to the rear guard by the commander in chief. The Cossack who accompanied Nesvitsky handed him a bag and a flask, and Nesvitsky treated the officers to savory little pies and real Doppelk&#252;mmel. The officers joyfully surrounded him, some kneeling, some sitting Turkish fashion on the wet grass.

�Yes, the Austrian prince who built a castle here was no fool. A fine place. Why aren�t you eating, gentlemen?� said Nesvitsky.

�I humbly thank you, Prince,� replied one of the officers, taking pleasure in conversing with such an important staff official. �An excellent place. We passed just by the park, saw two deer, and such a wonderful house!�

�Look, Prince,� said another, who very much wanted to take one more little pie, but was embarrassed, and who therefore pretended to be surveying the area, �look, our infantrymen have already gotten in there. Over there in the little meadow beyond the village, three of them are dragging something. They�ll ransack that castle,� he said with obvious approval.

�They will, they will,� said Nesvitsky. �No, but what I�d like,� he added, chewing a little pie with his handsome, moist mouth, �is to climb in there.�

He pointed to the convent with its towers, visible on the hilltop. He smiled, his eyes narrowed and lit up.

�Wouldn�t that be nice, gentlemen?�

The officers laughed.

�At least to put a fright into those little nuns. There are some Italian girls, young ones, they say. Really, I�d give five years of my life!�

�They must be bored, too,� an officer, a bolder one, said laughing.

Meanwhile, the officer of the suite, who was standing in front, was pointing something out to the general; the general was looking through the glass.

�Well, that�s it, that�s it,� the general said angrily, taking the glass from his eye and shrugging his shoulders, �that�s it, they�re going to fire on the crossing. And what are they dawdling for?�

On the other side the naked eye could make out the enemy and his battery, from which a puff of milk-white smoke appeared. The smoke was followed by the sound of a distant shot, and it could be seen how our troops speeded up at the crossing.

Nesvitsky, huffing, got up and, smiling, went over to the general.

�Wouldn�t Your Excellency like a bite to eat?� he said.

�A bad business,� said the general, not answering him, �our men have been dawdling.�

�Shouldn�t I ride over, Your Excellency?� said Nesvitsky.

�Yes, please do,� said the general, repeating what had already been ordered in detail, �and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and set fire to the bridge as I said, and inspect the flammable material while still on the bridge.�

�Very good, sir,� replied Nesvitsky.

He called the Cossack with the horse, told him to put the bag and flask away, and lightly swung his heavy body into the saddle.

�I�ll stop by those nuns, really,� he said to the officers, who were looking at him smilingly, and rode down the hill along a winding path.

�Well, let�s give it a try, Captain, see how far it will carry!� said the general, turning to the artillerist. �Have some fun out of boredom.�

�Crew, to your pieces!� the officer commanded, and in a minute the artillery crew ran merrily from their campfires and loaded up.

�One!� came the command.

Number one leaped back briskly. A deafening metallic sound rang out, and a shell flew whistling over the heads of all our men at the foot of the hill and, falling far short of the enemy, showed by a puff of smoke the place where it hit and burst.

The faces of the soldiers and officers cheered up at this sound; everybody stood up and began watching the movements of our troops below, visible as on the palm of the hand, and further away the movements of the advancing enemy. Just then the sun came all the way out from behind the clouds, and the beautiful sound of the solitary shot and the shining of the bright sun merged into one cheerful and merry impression.


VII

Two enemy cannonballs had already gone flying over the bridge, and there was a crush on the bridge itself. In the middle of the bridge, dismounted from his horse, his fat body pressed to the railing, stood Prince Nesvitsky. He looked back laughingly at his Cossack, who stood a few paces behind him holding the two horses by the bridle. The moment Prince Nesvitsky tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back and pressed him to the railing again, and there was nothing left for him but to smile.

�You there, brother!� the Cossack said to a supply soldier with a cart, who was pushing through the infantrymen crowded right against his wheels and horses, �you there! As if you can�t wait: look, the general needs to pass.�

But the supply soldier, paying no heed the denomination of general, shouted at the soldiers who blocked his way:

�Hey, countrymen! keep to the left, hold up!�

But the countrymen, pressed shoulder to shoulder, catching on their bayonets and never pausing, moved across the bridge in a solid mass. Looking down over the railing, Prince Nesvitsky saw the swift, noisy, low waves of the Enns, which, merging, rippling, and swirling around the pilings of the bridge, drove on one after the other. Looking at the bridge, he saw the same monotonous living waves of soldiers, shoulder braids, shakos with dustcovers, packs, bayonets, long muskets, and under the shakos faces with wide cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and carefree, weary faces, and feet moving over the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge. Occasionally, amidst the monotonous waves of soldiers, like a spray of white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer pushed his way through, in a cape, with his physiognomy distinct from the soldiers� occasionally, like a chip of wood swirled along by the river, a dismounted hussar, an orderly, or a local inhabitant was borne across the bridge by the waves of infantry; occasionally, like a log floating down the river, a company�s or an officer�s cart floated across the bridge, surrounded on all sides, loaded to the top, and covered with leather.

�Look at �em, it�s like a dam burst,� the Cossack said, stopping hopelessly. �Are there many of you there?�

�One shy of a million,� a merry soldier in a torn greatcoat, passing close by, said with a wink and vanished; after him came another old soldier.

�Once he� (he was the enemy) �starts peppering the bridge,� the old soldier said gloomily, addressing his comrade, �you�ll forget about scratching yourself.�

And the soldier passed by. After him came another soldier on a cart.

�Where the devil did you stuff those foot cloths?� said an orderly, running behind the cart and rummaging in the back.

And this one passed by with the cart.

After him came some merry and apparently tipsy soldiers.

�He just gave it to him, the dear fellow, right in the teeth with his musket butt�� one soldier in a high-tucked greatcoat said joyfully, swinging his arm widely.

�That�s it, the sweet taste of ham,� replied another with a guffaw.

And they passed by, so that Nesvitsky never learned who got it in the teeth and what the ham referred to.

�Look at �em scurrying! He fires off a cold one, and you�d think they were all getting killed,� a warrant officer said angrily and reproachfully.

�When that cannonball went flying by me, uncle,� a young soldier with a huge mouth said, barely holding back his laughter, �I just went dead. By God, I got scared really bad!� the soldier said, as if boasting that he was scared.

And that one passed by. After him came a cart unlike all those that had driven by so far. It was a German Vorspann and pair, loaded with what seemed like a whole household; behind the Vorspann, led by a German, was tied a beautiful spotted cow with a huge udder. A woman with a nursing baby, an old woman, and a young, healthy German girl with purple-red cheeks were sitting on featherbeds. It was clear that these were local people, who had been allowed to move by special permission. The eyes of all the soldiers turned to the women, and as the cart went by, moving step by step, all the soldiers� remarks were addressed only to these two women. All the soldiers� faces bore virtually one and the same smile of indecent thoughts about these women.

�Look, the sausage is also taking off!�

�Sell me the little lady,� another soldier said, with a stress on the last syllable, addressing the German, who, lowering his eyes, walked on with big strides, angry and frightened.

�Look how dressed up she is! The devils!�

�Nice to get billeted on them, Fedotov!�

�I should live so long, brother!�

�Where are you going?� asked an infantry officer, eating an apple, also with a half smile and looking at the beautiful girl.

The German shut his eyes to show that he did not understand.

�If you want it, take it,� said the officer, handing the apple to the girl.

The girl smiled and took it. Like everyone else on the bridge, Nesvitsky never took his eyes off the women until they had passed. Once they had passed, there again came the same soldiers, with the same talk, and finally everybody stopped. As often happens, the horses pulling the company cart balked at the exit from the bridge, and the whole crowd had to wait.

�What did they stop for? There�s no order!� said the soldiers. �What�s this shoving ahead? Devil take it! There�s such a thing as waiting. It�ll be worse if he sets fire to the bridge. See, even the officer got shoved aside,� the halted crowds were saying on different sides, looking at each other, and still pressing forward towards the exit.

Having looked under the bridge at the waters of the Enns, Nesvitsky suddenly heard a sound still new to him, the swift approach of�something big, and something splashed into the water.

�See what he�s fixing on!� a soldier standing nearby said sternly, turning towards the sound.

�He�s hustling us so we�ll cross quicker,� another said uneasily.

The crowd started moving again. Nesvitsky realized that it was a cannonball.

�Hey, Cossack, my horse!� he said. �Hey, you! Aside, step aside! make way!�

With great effort he reached his horse. Shouting constantly, he began to move ahead. The soldiers pressed back to let him pass, then pressed together again so hard that his leg was squashed, and those closest to him were not to blame, for they were pressed still harder.

�Nesvitsky! Nesvitsky! You rascal!� a hoarse voice came from behind just then.

Nesvitsky turned and saw, fifteen paces away, separated from him by the living mass of moving infantry, red, black, disheveled, his peaked cap pushed back, his dolman thrown dashingly over his shoulder�Vaska Denisov.

�Tell these damned devils to clear the road!� shouted Denisov, obviously in a fit of temper, his coal-black eyes with bloodshot whites rolling and shining, and waving his sheathed saber, which he held in a small, bare hand as red as his face.

�Hey! Vasya!� Nesvitsky replied joyfully. �What�s the matter?�

�The squadron can�t pass,� shouted Vaska Denisov, angrily baring his white teeth, spurring his handsome raven-black Bedouin, who, twitching his ears from running into bayonets, snorting, spraying foam around him from his bit, jingling, stamped his hooves on the planks of the bridge and seemed ready to jump over the railing if his rider would let him.

�What is this? like sheep! just like sheep! Away!�clear the road! Wait, you there! you with the cart, you devil! I�ll take my sword to you!� he shouted, actually drawing his saber and beginning to wave it.

The soldiers pressed close together with frightened faces, and Denisov joined Nesvitsky.

�How is it you�re not drunk today?� Nesvitsky said to Denisov, when he rode up to him.

�They don�t even give us time to drink!� replied Vaska Denisov. �They drag the regiment here and there all day. If it�s fighting, it�s fighting. Or else devil knows what it is!�

�What a dandy you are today!� said Nesvitsky, looking over his new dolman and saddlecloth.

Denisov smiled, took from his pouch a handkerchief that gave off a smell of scent, and put it to Nesvitsky�s nose.

�Have to be, I�m going into action! Shaved, brushed my teeth, and doused myself with scent.�

The stately figure of Nesvitsky, accompanied by the Cossack, and the resoluteness of Denisov, waving his saber and shouting desperately, had such an effect that they pushed through to the other end of the bridge and stopped the infantry. At the exit Nesvitsky found the colonel to whom he was to give the order, and, having fulfilled his mission, rode back again.

Having cleared the road, Denisov stopped at the entrance to the bridge. Casually holding back his stallion, who was straining towards his fellows and stamping his foot, he looked at the squadron that was moving towards him. The transparent sounds of hooves rang out on the planks of the bridge, as if several horses were galloping, and the squadron, with officers in front, four men abreast, stretched across the bridge and began to come out on the other side.

The halted infantry soldiers, crowding in the trampled mud by the bridge, gazed at the clean, foppish hussars going past them in order, with that special feeling of ill will, alienation, and mockery with which different branches of the military usually meet each other.

�Spruced-up lads! Fit for the fairground!�

�What�s the good of them! They�re only led around for show!� said another.

�Don�t raise dust, you footsloggers!� joked a hussar, whose horse, prancing, splashed mud at the infantryman.

�Make a couple of marches with a pack on your back, your fancy trim will turn shabby,� the infantryman said, wiping the mud from his face with his sleeve, �or maybe it�s not a man but a bird perched up there!�

�Wouldn�t you be a nimble one, Zikin, if they set you on a horse,� a corporal joked to a thin little soldier bent under a heavy pack.

�Put a stick between your legs, that�ll do you for a horse,� rejoined the hussar.


VIII

The rest of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing into a funnel at the entrance. Finally all the carts passed over, the crush eased up, and the last battalion entered the bridge. Only the hussars of Denisov�s squadron remained on the other side of the bridge facing the enemy. The enemy, visible in the distance from the opposite hill, were not yet visible from the bridge below, because, from the bottom where the river flowed, the horizon was bounded by the opposite heights less than half a mile away. Ahead was a deserted space over which clusters of our Cossack patrols moved here and there. Suddenly on the road going up the opposite heights appeared troops in blue coats and artillery. It was the French. A Cossack patrol moved down the hill at a trot. All the officers and men of Denisov�s squadron, though they tried to talk about unrelated things and look elsewhere, constantly thought only about what was there on the hill, and kept peering at the spots that appeared on the horizon, which they recognized as enemy troops. After midday the weather cleared again, the sun shone brightly, going down over the Danube and the dark hills around it. It was still, and once in a while from that hill floated the sounds of bugles and the shouts of the enemy. Between the squadron and the enemy there was now nothing but some small patrols. They were separated by an empty space of about six hundred yards. The enemy stopped shooting, and that strict, menacing, inaccessible, and elusive line that separates two enemy armies became all the more clearly felt.

�One step beyond that line, reminiscent of the line separating the living from the dead, and it�s the unknown, suffering, and death. And what is there? who is there? there, beyond this field, and the tree, and the roof lit by the sun? No one knows, and you would like to know; and you�re afraid to cross that line, and would like to cross it; and you know that sooner or later you will have to cross it and find out what is there on the other side of the line, as you will inevitably find out what is there on the other side of death. And you�re strong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and surrounded by people just as strong and excitedly animated.� So, if he does not think it, every man feels who finds himself within sight of an enemy, and this feeling gives a particular brilliance and joyful sharpness of impression to everything that happens in those moments.

On a knoll occupied by the enemy, the smoke of a shot appeared, and a cannonball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The officers, who were standing together, rode to their posts. The hussars assiduously began lining up their horses. Everything became hushed in the squadron. Everyone kept looking ahead at the enemy and at the squadron commander, awaiting a command. Another cannonball flew over, then a third. Obviously, the shots were aimed at the hussars; but the cannonballs, with a rapid, steady whistling, kept flying over the hussars� heads and hitting somewhere behind them. The hussars did not look back, but with each sound of a flying cannonball, the whole squadron, as if on command, with all their similarly dissimilar faces, holding their breath while the cannonball flew over, rose in their stirrups, then lowered themselves again. Without turning their heads, the soldiers looked sideways at each other, curious to spy out a comrade�s impressions. On each face, from Denisov�s down to the bugler�s, there appeared around the lips and chin one common trait of a struggle between irritation and excitement. The sergeant major frowned, looking the soldiers over as if threatening them with punishment. Junker Mironov ducked down each time a cannonball flew by. Rostov, standing on the left flank, on his slightly lame but imposing Little Rook, had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large public at an examination in which he is sure he will distinguish himself. He looked around at them all serenely and brightly, as if asking them to pay attention to how calmly he stood under fire. But on his face, too, that same trait of something new and stern appeared, against his will, around the mouth.

�Who�s that bowing there? Junker Mironov! Not right, look at me!� shouted Denisov, who could not stay still and fidgeted on his horse in front of the squadron.

Vaska Denisov�s pug-nosed and black-haired face, and his whole small, compact figure with his sinewy hand (the short fingers covered with hair), in which he gripped the hilt of his bared saber, was the same as ever, especially towards evening, after drinking a couple of bottles. Only he was more red than usual and, throwing his shaggy head back, the way birds do when they drink, and mercilessly digging the spurs on his small feet into the sides of the good Bedouin, he galloped off, as if falling backwards, to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice that they should inspect their pistols. He rode up to Kirsten. The staff captain, on his broad and sedate mare, rode slowly to meet Denisov. The staff captain, with his long mustaches, was as serious as ever, only his eyes shone more than usual.

�Well, what?� he said to Denisov. �It won�t come to a fight. You�ll see, we�ll withdraw.�

�Devil knows what they�re up to!� Denisov grumbled. �Ah! Rostov!� he cried to the junker, noticing his cheerful face. �Well, you�re done waiting!�

And he smiled approvingly, obviously glad for the junker. Rostov felt himself perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge. Denisov galloped towards him.

�Your Excellency! allow us to attack! I�ll crush them!�

�Attack, indeed!� the colonel said in a bored voice, wincing as if a fly was pestering him. �And why are you standing here? You can see the flanks are retreating. Bring the squadron back across.�

The squadron crossed the bridge and moved out of the range of fire without losing a single man. After them the second squadron, forming a line, also crossed, and the last Cossacks cleared off from that side.

Having crossed the bridge, the two squadrons of the Pavlogradsky hussars went back up the hill one after the other. The regimental commander, Karl Bogdanovich Schubert, rode over to Denisov�s squadron and fell in step with them not far from Rostov, paying no attention to him, though this was the first time they had seen each other since their confrontation over Telyanin. Rostov, feeling himself at the front and in the power of a man before whom he now considered himself guilty, fixed his eyes on the athletic back, blond nape, and red neck of the regimental commander. At first it seemed to Rostov that Bogdanych was only pretending to be inattentive and that his whole goal now consisted in testing the junker�s courage, and he sat up straight and looked around cheerfully. Then it seemed to him that Bogdanych was deliberately riding close to him in order to show Rostov his own courage. Then he thought that his enemy would now deliberately send the squadron into a desperate attack in order to punish him, Rostov. Then he thought that, after the attack, he would come to him as he lay wounded and magnanimously offer him a conciliatory hand.

Zherkov, with his shoulders raised high, a familiar figure to the Pavlogradsky hussars (he had recently quit their regiment), rode up to the regimental commander. After his expulsion from the head staff, Zherkov had not remained with the regiment, saying that he was no fool to drudge away at the front when he could get more decorations while doing nothing on the staff, and he had managed to set himself up as an orderly officer for Prince Bagration. He came to his former superior with an order from the commander of the rear guard.

�Colonel,� he said with his gloomy earnestness, addressing Rostov�s enemy and looking around at his comrades, �there is an order to stop and set fire to the bridge.�

�An order of who?� the colonel asked sullenly.

�I don�t know of who, Colonel,� the cornet replied earnestly, �only the prince told me: �Go and tell the colonel that the hussars must turn back quickly and set fire to the bridge.��

After Zherkov, an officer of the suite rode up to the hussar colonel with the same order. After the officer of the suite, on a Cossack horse that was barely able to gallop under him, fat Nesvitsky rode up.

�What is this, Colonel?� he cried while still riding. �I told you to set fire to the bridge, and somebody got it wrong; everybody�s going crazy there, they can�t figure it out.�

The colonel unhurriedly halted his regiment and turned to Nesvitsky.

�You spoke to me about flammable material,� he said, �but you said nothing to me about setting feuer to it.�

�What do you mean, my dear man?� Nesvitsky said, stopping, taking off his cap, and smoothing his sweat-dampened hair with a plump hand. �What do you mean I didn�t tell you to set fire to the bridge, since you put flammable material there?�

�I am not �dear man� to you, Mister Staff Officer, and you did not tell me to set feuer to the bridge! I know the serfiss, and I am habituated to strictly fulfilling orders. You said the bridge vas to be set on feuer, but who vould set it on feuer I cannot know by the Holy Spirit��

�It�s always like that,� Nesvitsky said, waving his hand. �What are you doing here?� he turned to Zherkov.

�The same as you. You�re soaking wet, though, let me wring you out.�

�You said, Mister Staff Officer�� the colonel went on in an offended tone.

�Colonel,� the officer of the suite interrupted, �you must hurry, otherwise the enemy will move up his canister guns.�

The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the fat staff officer, at Zherkov, and frowned.

�I vill set feuer to the bridge,� he said in a solemn tone, as if to show that, despite all the unpleasantness done to him, he would still do what he had to do.

Striking his horse with his long, muscular legs, as if it was all the horse�s fault, the colonel moved forward and commanded the second squadron, the one in which Rostov served under Denisov, to go back to the bridge.

�Well, that�s it,� thought Rostov, �he wants to test me!� His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face. �Let him see whether I�m a coward,� he thought.

Again there appeared on all the cheerful faces of the men of the squadron that serious trait that had been there when they were under fire. Rostov, never taking his eyes away, kept looking at his enemy, the regimental commander, wishing to find on his face a confirmation of his surmises; but the colonel never once glanced at Rostov, but, as always at the front, looked stern and solemn. The command was heard.

�Step lively! Step lively!� several voices said near him.

Their sabers catching in their bridles, their spurs jingling, the hussars hurriedly dismounted, not knowing themselves what they were going to do. The hussars crossed themselves. Rostov no longer looked at the regimental commander�he had no time. He was afraid, with a sinking heart he was afraid to lag behind the hussars. His hand shook as he turned his horse over to the handler, and he felt the blood throbbing as it rose to his heart. Denisov, lurching backwards and shouting something, rode past him. Rostov saw nothing but the hussars running around him, their spurs catching and their sabers clanking.

�Stretcher!� someone�s voice shouted behind.

Rostov did not think of what the call for a stretcher meant; he ran on, trying only to be ahead of everyone else; but just by the bridge, not looking under his feet, he got into the slimy, trampled mud, stumbled, and fell on his hands. Others ran past him.

�On bote sides, Captain,� he heard the voice of the regimental commander, who, having ridden ahead, stood mounted near the bridge with a triumphant and merry face.

Rostov, wiping his muddy hands on his breeches, looked at his enemy and wanted to run further, supposing that the further ahead he got, the better it would be. But Bogdanych, though he neither looked at nor recognized Rostov, shouted at him.

�Who�s that running in the middle of the bridge? Keep to the right! Back, junker!� he cried out angrily and turned to Denisov, who, flaunting his courage, rode out onto the planks of the bridge.

�Vy riskiert, Captain! Better dismount,� said the colonel.

�Eh! it�ll find the one it�s meant for,� replied Denisov, turning on his saddle.

Meanwhile, Nesvitsky, Zherkov, and the officer of the suite stood together out of the range of fire and looking at this small bunch of men in yellow shakos, dark green jackets embroidered with cord, and blue breeches, pottering about by the bridge and, on the other side, at blue coats and groups with horses, which could easily be identified as artillery, approaching in the distance.

�Will they set fire to it or won�t they? Who�ll be first? Will they run and set fire to the bridge, or will the French come within canister-shot range and kill them all?� These questions were involuntarily asked with sinking heart by each man of that large mass of troops which stood above the bridge and in the bright evening light looked at the bridge and the hussars and, on the other side, at the advancing blue coats with bayonets and guns.

�Ah! the hussars are going to get it!� said Nesvitsky. �It�s close enough for canister shot now.�

�He shouldn�t have taken so many men,� said the officer of the suite.

�Indeed not,� said Nesvitsky. �If he�d sent two brave lads, it would be the same.�

�Ah, Your Excellency,� Zherkov mixed in, not taking his eyes from the hussars, but still with his na&#239;ve manner, which made it impossible to tell whether he was speaking seriously or not. �Ah, Your Excellency! What a way to reason! Send two men, and who�s going to give us a Vladimir with a bow? This way they may get beaten, but the squadron will be distinguished, and he�ll get a bow. Our Bogdanych knows the system.�

�Well,� said the officer of the suite, �there�s the canisters!�

He pointed to the French guns, which were being taken from their limbers and hurriedly deployed.

On the French side, among those groups where the guns were, a puff of smoke appeared, a second, a third almost simultaneously, and just as the sound of the first shot reached them, a fourth appeared. Two sounds one after another, and a third.

�Oh, oh!� gasped Nesvitsky, as if from burning pain, seizing the officer of the suite by the arm. �Look, he�s fallen, one of them has fallen, fallen!�

�Two of them, I believe?�

�If I were the tsar, I�d never go to war,� Nesvitsky said, turning away.

The French guns were being hurriedly reloaded. The infantry in blue coats moved towards the bridge at a run. Again puffs of smoke appeared at various intervals, and canister shot went crackling and rattling over the bridge. But this time Nesvitsky could not see what was happening on the bridge. Thick smoke rose from it. The hussars had managed to set fire to the bridge, and the French batteries were now shooting not in order to hinder them, but because the guns had been aimed and there were people to shoot at.

The French managed to fire three rounds of canister shot before the hussars got back to the horse-tenders. Two of the rounds were poorly aimed and all the shot went overhead, but the last round landed in the middle of a bunch of hussars and brought down three of them.

Rostov, preoccupied by his relations with Bogdanych, stopped on the bridge, not knowing what to do with himself. There was no one to cut down (as he had always pictured battle to himself), nor could he help set fire to the bridge, because, unlike the other soldiers, he had not brought a plait of straw with him. He was standing and looking about, when suddenly there was a rattling on the bridge, as if someone had spilled nuts, and one of the hussars, the one nearest him, fell on the railing with a groan. Rostov ran to him with the others. Again someone cried: �Stretcher!� Four men took hold of the hussar and began to lift him up.

�Oooh! Leave me alone, for Christ�s sake,� the wounded man cried; but all the same they lifted him up and laid him on the stretcher.

Nikolai Rostov turned away, and, as if searching for something, began looking at the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, at the sun! How good the sky seemed, how blue, calm, and deep! How bright and solemn the setting sun! How tenderly and lustrously glistened the waters of the distant Danube! And better still were the distant blue hills beyond the Danube, the convent, the mysterious gorges, the pine forests bathed in mist to their tops�there was peace, happiness��There�s nothing, nothing I would wish for, there�s nothing I would wish for, if only I were there,� thought Rostov. �In me alone and in this sun there is so much happiness, but here�groans, suffering, fear, and this obscurity, this hurry�Again they�re shouting something, and again everybody�s run back somewhere, and I�m running with them, and here it is, here it is, death, above me, around me�An instant, and I�ll never again see this sun, this water, this gorge��

Just then the sun began to hide itself behind the clouds. Ahead of Rostov, another stretcher appeared. And his fear of death and the stretcher, and his love of the sun and life�all merged into one painfully disturbing impression.

�Lord God! the one there in this sky, save, forgive, and protect me!� Rostov whispered to himself.

The hussars ran up to the handlers, the voices became louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.

�What, brother, got a whiff of powder?� Denisov�s voice shouted by his ear.

�It�s all over, but I�m a coward, yes, I�m a coward,� thought Rostov and, sighing deeply, he took his lame Little Rook from the handler and began to mount.

�What was it, canister shot?� he asked Denisov.

�And then some!� shouted Denisov. �Good work, lads! And it was a rotten job! Attacking�s a lovely thing, cut �em to pieces, but here, devil knows, it�s more like target practice.�

And Denisov rode off to a group that had stopped not far from Rostov: the regimental commander, Nesvitsky, Zherkov, and the officer of the suite.

�However, it seems nobody noticed,� Rostov thought to himself. And indeed no one had noticed anything, because they were all familiar with the feeling a junker experiences when he is under fire for the first time.

�There�ll be a report in it for you,� said Zherkov. �Just see if I don�t get promoted sublieutenant.�

�Inform the prince that I haf set feuer to the bridge,� the colonel said triumphantly and cheerfully.

�And what if he asks about the losses?�

�Trifles!� the colonel boomed. �Two hussars wounded and one killed on the spot,� he said with obvious joy, unable to hold back a happy smile, sonorously rapping out the beautiful phrase killed on the spot.


IX

Pursued by the hundred-thousand-man French army under the leadership of Bonaparte, encountering a hostile local populace, no longer trusting their allies, suffering from a shortness of supplies, and forced to act outside all foreseeable conditions of war, the thirty-five-thousand-man Russian army, under the leadership of Kutuzov, hastily retreated down the Danube, stopping whenever the enemy caught up with it and fighting rear-guard actions, only insofar as it was necessary in order to retreat without loss of heavy equipment. There was action at Lambach, Amstetten, and M&#246;lk; but despite the courage and steadfastness, acknowledged by the enemy themselves, with which the Russians fought, the result of these actions was only a still speedier retreat. The Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and joined Kutuzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and Kutuzov was left with nothing but his own weak, exhausted forces. To defend Vienna was no longer thinkable. Instead of the offensive war, profoundly thought out according to the laws of the new science of strategy, the plan of which had been given to Kutuzov while in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole, almost unattainable goal now remaining for Kutuzov was to unite with the troops coming from Russia without losing his own army, as Mack had done at Ulm.

On the twenty-eighth of October, Kutuzov crossed with his army to the left bank of the Danube and halted for the first time, having put the Danube between himself and the main forces of the French. On the thirtieth he attacked Mortier�s division, which was on the left bank of the Danube, and crushed it. In this action trophies were taken for the first time: a banner, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a two-week retreat, the Russian troops halted and after the fighting not only held the field of battle but drove the French away. Despite the fact that the troops were ill-clad, worn-out, weakened by a third with the stragglers, the wounded, the dead, and the sick; despite the fact that the sick and the wounded had been left on the other side of the Danube with a letter from Kutuzov entrusting them to the humaneness of the enemy; despite the fact that the big hospitals and the houses in Krems that had been turned into infirmaries could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded�despite all that, the halt at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of the troops significantly. Throughout the army and in headquarters joyful, though incorrect, rumors were rife about the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, about some victory won by the Austrians, and about the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.

At the time of the battle, Prince Andrei was attached to the Austrian general Schmidt, killed in that action. His horse had been shot from under him, and his arm had been slightly grazed by a bullet. As a sign of special favor, the commander in chief had sent him with news of the victory to the Austrian court, no longer in Vienna, which was threatened by the French, but in Br&#252;nn. On the night of the battle, Prince Andrei, agitated but not tired (despite his apparently slight build, Prince Andrei could endure physical fatigue far better than the strongest people), having come on horseback with a message from Dokhturov to Kutuzov in Krems, was sent that same night as a courier to Br&#252;nn. Being sent as a courier, apart from its rewards, also signified an important step towards promotion.

The night was dark, starry; the road lay black amidst the white snow that had fallen that day, the day of the battle. Now going over his impressions of the past battle, now joyfully imagining the impression he would make with his news of the victory, recalling his leavetaking from the commander in chief and his comrades, Prince Andrei galloped along in a post britzka, experiencing the feeling of a man who has long been awaiting and has finally achieved the beginning of the happiness he desired. As soon as he closed his eyes, the firing of muskets and cannon resounded in his ears, merging with the rattle of the carriage and the impression of the victory. Now he would begin to imagine that the Russians were fleeing, that he himself had been killed; but then he would hurriedly wake up and happily learn as if for the first time that none of it had happened and that, on the contrary, the French had fled. He would recall once more all the details of the victory, his calm manliness during the battle, and, reassured, would doze off�After the dark starry night came a bright, cheerful morning. The snow melted in the sun, the horses galloped swiftly, and to right and left alike passed new and various forests, fields, villages.

At one of the posting stations he overtook a convoy carrying Russian wounded. The Russian officer who was leading the transport, sprawled in the front cart, shouted something, abusing a soldier in rude terms. Six or more pale, bandaged, and dirty wounded went jolting down the rocky road in each of the long German Vorspanns. Some of them were talking (he heard Russian speech), others were eating bread, the most seriously wounded gazed at the courier galloping past them silently, with a meek and sickly childish interest.

Prince Andrei ordered the driver to stop and asked the soldiers what action they had been wounded in.

�Two days ago on the Danube,� a soldier replied. Prince Andrei took out a purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces.

�For all of you,� he added, addressing the approaching officer. �Get well, lads,� he said to the soldiers, �there�s still a lot to be done.�

�Well, Mister Adjutant, what news?� asked the officer, obviously wishing to strike up a conversation.

�Good news!�Drive on,� he cried to the coachman and galloped on his way.

It was already quite dark when Prince Andrei drove into Br&#252;nn and saw himself surrounded by tall buildings, lighted shops, windows, street lamps, fine carriages noisily driving over the pavement, and all the atmosphere of a big, lively town, which is always so attractive for a military man after camp life. Prince Andrei, despite the quick driving and the sleepless night, felt himself still more animated than the day before as he pulled up to the palace. Only his eyes shone with a feverish gleam and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary speed and clarity. He vividly pictured again all the details of the battle, not vaguely now, but in the well-defined, concise account which, in his imagination, he was giving to the emperor Franz. He vividly pictured the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give to them. He supposed that he would be presented to the emperor at once. But at the main entrance to the palace, an official came running out to him and, recognizing that he was a courier, led him to another entrance.

�To the right from the corridor; there, Euer Hochgeboren, you will find the imperial adjutant on duty,� said the official. �He will take you to the minister of war.�

The imperial adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrei, asked him to wait and went to the minister of war. Five minutes later the imperial adjutant returned and, inclining with particular courtesy and letting Prince Andrei go ahead of him, led him down the corridor to the office where the minister of war worked. The imperial adjutant seemed to want to protect himself from any attempts at familiarity from the Russian adjutant. Prince Andrei�s joyful feeling weakened significantly as he approached the doors of the minister of war�s office. He felt offended, and the feeling of offense turned that same instant, without his noticing it, into a feeling of totally groundless scorn. His resourceful mind suggested to him that same instant the point of view from which he had the right to scorn both the adjutant and the minister of war. �To him it must seem very easy to win a victory, having never had a whiff of powder!� he thought. His eyes narrowed scornfully; he entered the minister of war�s office especially slowly. This feeling increased still more when he saw the minister of war sitting at the big desk and for the first two minutes paying no attention to the one who had entered. The minister of war had lowered his bald head with gray temples between two wax candles and was reading some papers, making notes with a pencil. He went on reading to the end, without raising his head, when the door opened and footsteps were heard.

�Take this and deliver it,� the minister of war said to his adjutant, handing him the papers and still paying no attention to the courier.

Prince Andrei felt that either, of all the matters that occupied the minister of war, the actions of Kutuzov�s army must interest him the least, or that he had to give the Russian courier that feeling. �But it�s all quite the same to me,� he thought. The minister of war put the rest of the papers together, stacked them evenly, and raised his head. He had an intelligent and characteristic head. But the moment he turned to Prince Andrei, the intelligent and firm expression on the minister of war�s face changed, evidently habitually and consciously: there remained on his face the stupid, feigned smile, which did not conceal its feigning, of a man who receives many petitioners one after the other.

�From General Field Marshal Kutuzov?� he asked. �With good news, I hope? There was an encounter with Mortier? A victory? About time!�

He took the dispatch, which was addressed to him, and began reading it with a sorrowful expression.

�Ah, my God! My God! Schmidt!� he said in German. �What a misfortune! What a misfortune!�

Having looked through the dispatch, he put it on the table and glanced at Prince Andrei, clearly weighing something.

�Ah, what a misfortune! You say it was a decisive action? Mortier wasn�t taken, however.� (He reflected.) �I�m very glad you�ve come with good news, though Schmidt�s death is a high price for a victory. His Majesty will certainly wish to see you, but not today. Thank you, get some rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade. I�ll let you know, however.�

The stupid smile that had disappeared during the conversation reappeared on the minister of war�s face.

�Good-bye, thank you very much. The sovereign emperor will probably wish to see you,� he repeated and inclined his head.

When Prince Andrei left the palace, he felt that all the interest and happiness afforded him by the victory had now left him and been given over into the indifferent hands of the minister of war and the courteous adjutant. His whole way of thinking changed instantly: the battle appeared to him now as a long-past, far-off memory.

Prince Andrei stayed in Br&#252;nn with his acquaintance, the Russian diplomat Bilibin.

�Ah, dear prince, there�s no guest more welcome,� said Bilibin, coming out to meet Prince Andrei. �Franz, take the prince�s things to my bedroom!� he turned to the servant who accompanied Bolkonsky. �What, are you a herald of victory? Excellent. And I�m sitting here sick, as you see.�

Prince Andrei, having washed and dressed, came out to the diplomat�s luxurious study and sat down to the prepared dinner. Bilibin settled comfortably by the fireplace.

Not only after his trip, but after the whole campaign, during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and the refinements of life, Prince Andrei experienced the pleasant feeling of repose amidst the luxurious conditions of life to which he had been accustomed since childhood. Besides, it was pleasant for him, after his Austrian reception, to speak, if not Russian (they spoke French), at least with a Russian man, who, he supposed, shared the general Russian aversion (now especially sharply felt) to the Austrians.

Bilibin was a man of about thirty-five, a bachelor, of the same society as Prince Andrei. They had been acquainted back in Petersburg, but had become more closely acquainted during Prince Andrei�s visit to Vienna with Kutuzov. As Prince Andrei was a young man who promised to go far in his military career, so, and still more, was Bilibin promising in the diplomacy. He was still a young man, but no longer a young diplomat, since he had begun to serve at the age of sixteen, had been in Paris, in Copenhagen, and now occupied a rather important post in Vienna. Both the chancellor and our ambassador in Vienna knew him and valued him. He did not belong to that large number of diplomats whose duty it is to have only negative merits, to not do certain things, and to speak French so as to be very good diplomats; he was one of those diplomats who like and know how to work, and, despite his laziness, he occasionally spent nights at his desk. He worked equally well whatever the essence of the work consisted of. He was interested not in the question �Why?� but in the question �How?� What the diplomatic business consisted of made no difference to him; but to compose a circular, a memorandum, a report artfully, aptly, and elegantly�in that he took great pleasure. Bilibin�s merits were valued, apart from his written work, also for his skill at moving and speaking in higher spheres.

Bilibin liked conversation, just as he liked work, only when the conversation could be elegantly witty. In society he constantly waited for the opportunity to say something remarkable and entered into conversation not otherwise than on that condition. Bilibin�s conversation was constantly sprinkled with wittily original and well-turned phrases of general interest. These phrases were manufactured in Bilibin�s inner laboratory, as if intentionally of a portable nature, so that society nonentities could readily remember them and pass them on from drawing room to drawing room. And indeed, les mots de Bilibine se colportaient dans les salons de Vienne, as they say, and often had an influence on so-called important affairs.

His thin, drawn, yellowish face was all covered with deep wrinkles, which always looked as neatly and thoroughly washed as one�s fingertips after a bath. The movements of these wrinkles constituted the main play of his physiognomy. Now his forehead would wrinkle into wide folds as his eyebrows rose, then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would form on his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always looked out directly and merrily.

�Well, now tell us about your exploits,� he said.

In a most modest way, not once mentioning himself, Bolkonsky told about the action and his reception by the minister of war.

�Ils m�ont re&#231;u avec ma nouvelle comme un chien dans un jeu de quilles,� he concluded.

Bilibin smiled and released the folds of his skin.

�Cependant, mon cher,� he said, studying his fingernail from a distance and gathering up the skin over his left eye, �malgr&#233; la haute estime que je professe pour le Orthodox Russian armed forces,j�avoue que votre victoire n�est pas des plus victorieuses.�

He went on in the same way, in French, pronouncing in Russian only those words he wanted to underscore contemptuously.

�How, then? With all your mass you fell upon the unfortunate Mortier with his one division, and this Mortier slips between your fingers? Where�s the victory?�

�All the same, seriously speaking,� replied Prince Andrei, �we can still say without boasting that this is a bit better than Ulm��

�Why didn�t you capture us at least one, at least one marshal?�

�Because not everything goes as it�s supposed to, and with such regularity as on parade. We planned, as I told you, to attack their rear by seven in the morning, but we didn�t even get there by five in the afternoon.�

�But why didn�t you get there at seven in the morning? You had to get there at seven in the morning,� Bilibin said, smiling, �you had to get there at seven in the morning.�

�And why didn�t you convince Bonaparte through diplomatic channels that he�d better leave Genoa?� Prince Andrei said in the same tone.

�I know,� Bilibin interrupted, �you think it�s very easy to capture marshals while sitting on a sofa in front of a fireplace. That�s true, but even so, why didn�t you capture him? And don�t be surprised if not only the minister of war, but the most august emperor and king Franz is not made very happy by your victory; nor do I, a miserable secretary of the Russian embassy, feel any particular joy��

He looked straight at Prince Andrei and suddenly relaxed all the skin gathered on his forehead.

�Now it�s my turn to ask you �why,� my dear,� said Bolkonsky. �I confess to you that I don�t understand, maybe there are diplomatic subtleties here that are beyond my feeble mind, but I don�t understand: Mack loses a whole army, the archduke Ferdinand and the archduke Karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder, Kutuzov alone finally gains a real victory, destroys the charme of the French, and the minister of war isn�t even interested in learning the details!�

�Precisely for that reason, my dear. Voyez-vous, mon cher: hurrah for the tsar, for Rus, for the faith! Tout &#231;a est bel et bon, but what do we�I mean the Austrian court�care about your victories? Bring us some nice little news about a victory of the archduke Karl or Ferdinand�un archiduc vaut l�autre, as you know�even over a fire brigade of Bonaparte�s, and that will be a different story, we�ll shoot off all our cannons. Whereas this, as if on purpose, can only exasperate us. The archduke Karl does nothing, the archduke Ferdinand covers himself in shame. You abandon Vienna, you no longer protect it, comme si vous disiez: God is with us, and God help you and your capital. There was one general we all loved: Schmidt. You put him in the path of a bullet and congratulate us with your victory!�You must agree that to think up more exasperating news than what you�ve brought would be impossible. C�est comme un fait expr&#233;s, comme un fait expr&#233;s. Besides that, well, if you were to gain a truly brilliant victory, if the archduke Karl were even to gain a victory, what would it change in the general course of affairs? It�s too late now, since Vienna�s occupied by French troops.�

�Occupied? Vienna occupied?�

�Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is in Sch&#246;nbrunn, and the count, our dear Count Vrbna, is going to him for orders.�

After the fatigues and impressions of the journey, the reception, and especially after dinner, Bolkonsky felt that he did not quite understand the full significance of the words he had heard.

�This morning Count Lichtenfels was here,� Bilibin went on, �and he showed me a letter which described in detail the parade of the French in Vienna. Le prince Murat et tout le tremblement� You see that your victory doesn�t bring much joy and that you can�t be received as a savior��

�Really, it�s all the same to me, all quite the same!� said Prince Andrei, beginning to realize that his news about the battle at Krems was indeed of little importance in view of such events as the occupation of the capital of Austria. �How is it that Vienna�s been taken? What about the bridge? And the famous t&#234;te de pont, and Prince Auersperg? There was a rumor among us that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna,� he said.

�Prince Auersperg is standing on this side, our side, and defending us; I suppose he�s defending us very poorly, but still he�s defending us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been taken and, I hope, will not be taken, because it�s mined and there�s an order to blow it up. Otherwise we�d have been in the mountains of Bohemia long ago, and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires.�

�That still doesn�t mean the campaign is over,� said Prince Andrei.

�But I think it�s over. And the bigwigs here think so, too, though they don�t dare say it. It will turn out as I said at the beginning of the campaign, that the matter won�t be decided by your &#233;chauffour&#233;e de D&#252;renstein, nor by gunpowder, but by those who invented gunpowder,� said Bilibin, repeating one of his mots, releasing the skin on his forehead, and pausing. �The only question is what the meeting in Berlin between the emperor Alexander and the king of Prussia will tell us. If Prussia enters the alliance, on forcera la main &#224; l�Autriche, and there will be war. If not, it will only be a matter of arranging where to draw up the preliminary articles for a new Campo Formio.�

�But what an extraordinary genius!� Prince Andrei cried suddenly, clenching his small fist and pounding it on the table. �And what luck the man has!�

�Buonaparte?� Bilibin said questioningly, wrinkling his forehead and with that letting it be felt that a mot was coming. �Buonaparte?� he said with special emphasis on the u. �I think, however, that now that he�s prescribing laws for Austria from Sch&#246;nbrunn, il faut lui faire gr&#226;ce de l�u. I decidedly make an innovation and call him Bonaparte tout court.�

�No, joking aside,� said Prince Andrei, �do you really think the campaign is over?�

�Here�s what I think. Austria�s been played for a fool, and she�s not used to it. And she�ll pay it back. She�s been played for a fool because, first, the provinces are devastated (on dit, le Orthodox army est terrible pour le pillage), her army is destroyed, her capital has been taken, and all that pour les beaux yeux du his Sardinian majesty. And therefore�entre nous, mon cher �I feel instinctively that we�re being deceived, I feel instinctively that communications with France and plans for peace, a secret peace, are being concluded separately.�

�That can�t be!� said Prince Andrei. �It would be too vile.�

�Qui vivra verra,� said Bilibin, again releasing his skin as a sign that the conversation was over.

When Prince Andrei went to the room prepared for him and lay down on the featherbed and fragrant, warmed-up pillows in clean linen�he felt that the battle, the news of which he had brought, was far, far away from him. The Prussian alliance, the treachery of Austria, the new triumph of Bonaparte, the levee, and the parade, and his reception by the emperor Franz the next day preoccupied him.

He closed his eyes, but at that same instant in his ears there crackled a cannonade, gunfire, the rattle of carriage wheels, and now again the stretched-out line of musketeers goes down the hill, and the French are shooting, and he feels his heart thrill, and he is riding in front next to Schmidt, and bullets are whistling merrily around him, and he experiences that feeling of the tenfold joy of life, such as he has not experienced since childhood.

He woke up�

�Yes, all that happened!�� he said, smiling happily to himself like a child, and he fell into a sound, youthful sleep.



XI

The next day he woke up late. Going over his recent impressions, he remembered first of all that he had to present himself to the emperor Franz that day, remembered the minister of war, the courteous Austrian imperial adjutant, Bilibin, and the conversation yesterday evening. Putting on his full dress uniform, which he had not worn in a long time, for his trip to the palace, fresh, animated, and handsome, with his arm in a sling, he went into Bilibin�s study. In the study there were four gentlemen from the diplomatic corps. Bolkonsky was acquainted with Prince Ippolit Kuragin, who was a secretary at the embassy; Bilibin introduced him to the others.

The gentlemen who frequented Bilibin, young, rich, and merry society people, constituted here, as in Vienna, a separate circle, which Bilibin, who was the head of it, called �ours��les n&#244;tres. This circle, made up almost exclusively of diplomats, clearly had its own high-society interests, which had nothing in common with war and politics, interests in relations with certain women and in the administrative side of their service. These gentlemen received Prince Andrei into their circle with apparent eagerness, as �theirs� (an honor they accorded to few). Out of courtesy and as a subject for getting into conversation, he was asked several questions about the army and the battle, and the conversation again broke up into inconsequentially merry jokes and gossip.

�But it was especially nice,� one said, telling about a fellow diplomat�s failure, �it was especially nice that the chancellor told him straight out that his appointment to London was a promotion and that he should look at it as such. Can you picture his face when he heard that?��

�But what�s worst of all, gentlemen�I�m betraying Kuragin to you�is that the man is in misfortune, and this Don Juan, this terrible fellow, is taking advantage of it!�

Prince Ippolit was lying in a Voltaire armchair, his legs thrown over the arm-rest. He laughed.

�Parlez-moi de &#231;a,� he said.

�Oh, you Don Juan! Oh, you serpent!� said various voices.

�You don�t know, Bolkonsky,� Bilibin turned to Prince Andrei, �that all the horrors of the French army (I almost said the Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women.�

�La femme est la compagne de l�homme,� uttered Prince Ippolit, and he began examining his raised feet through his lorgnette.

Bilibin and �ours� burst out laughing, looking Ippolit in the eye. Prince Andrei saw that this Ippolit, of whom he (it had to be admitted) had almost been jealous over his wife, was the buffoon of the company.

�No, I must treat you to Kuragin,� Bilibin said softly to Bolkonsky. �He�s charming when he argues about politics, you should see such gravity.�

He sat beside Ippolit and, gathering the folds of his forehead, began a conversation about politics with him. Prince Andrei and the others stood around them.

�Le cabinet de Berlin ne peut pas exprimer un sentiment d�alliance,� Ippolit began, looking around significantly at them all, �sans exprimer�comme dans sa derni&#232;re note�vous comprenez�vous comprenez�et puis si sa Majest&#233; l�Empereur ne d&#233;roge pas au principe de notre alliance��

�Attendez, je n�ai pas fini�� he said to Prince Andrei, seizing him by the arm. �Je suppose que l�intervention sera plus forte que la non-intervention. Et�� He paused. �On ne pourra pas imputer &#224; la fin de nonrecevoir notre d&#233;p&#234;che du 28 novembre. Voil&#224; comment tout cela finira.�

And he let go of Bolkonsky�s arm, thus indicating that he was quite finished.

�D&#233;mosth&#232;ne, je te reconnais au caillou que tu as cach&#233; dans ta bouche d�or!� said Bilibin, whose shock of hair moved on his head with pleasure.

They all laughed. Ippolit laughed more than anyone else. He obviously suffered, choked, but was unable to hold back the wild laughter that distended his ever immobile face.

�Well, I tell you what, gentlemen,� said Bilibin, �Bolkonsky is a guest in my house and here in Br&#252;nn, and I want to treat him, as far as I can, to all the joys of life here. If we were in Vienna, that would be easy; but here, dans ce vilain trou morave it�s harder, and I ask you all to help. Il faut lui faire les honneurs de Br&#252;nn. You�ll take the theater upon yourselves, I�ll take society, and you, Ippolit, naturally, the women.�

�We must show him Am&#233;lie�charming!� said one of �ours,� kissing the tips of his fingers.

�Generally, this bloodthirsty soldier,� said Bilibin, �needs to be converted to more humane views.�

�It�s unlikely that I�ll take advantage of your hospitality, gentlemen, and it�s now time for me to go,� Bolkonsky said, glancing at his watch.

�Where?�

�To the emperor.�

�Oh! oh! oh!�

�Well, good-bye, Bolkonsky! Good-bye, Prince; come early to dinner,� said several voices. �We�ll take good care of you.�

�Try to praise the order for the delivery of provisions and the itineraries as much as possible to the emperor,� said Bilibin, seeing Bolkonsky off to the front hall.

�I wish I could, but I can�t, as far as I know,� Bolkonsky replied, smiling.

�Well, generally, talk as much as possible. Audiences are his passion; but he neither likes nor is able to talk himself, as you�ll see.�


XII

At the levee, the emperor Franz merely looked intently into the face of Prince Andrei, who was standing in the place assigned to him among the Austrian officers, and nodded his long head at him. But after the levee, yesterday�s imperial adjutant courteously conveyed to Bolkonsky the emperor�s wish to grant him an audience. The emperor Franz received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the conversation began, it struck Prince Andrei that the emperor was as if confused, did not know what to say, and blushed.

�Tell me, when did the battle begin?� he asked hastily.

Prince Andrei replied. After that question, other equally simple questions followed: �Was Kutuzov in good health? How long ago had he left Krems?� and so on. The emperor spoke with such an expression as if his whole goal consisted in asking a certain number of questions. The replies to these questions, as was only too clear, were of no interest to him.

�At what time did the battle begin?� asked the emperor.

�I am unable to tell Your Majesty at what time the battle at the front began, but in D&#252;renstein, where I was, the troops went into attack between five and six o�clock in the evening,� said Bolkonsky, livening up and supposing on this occasion that he would be able to present the truthful description already prepared in his head of all he knew and had seen.

But the emperor smiled and interrupted him:

�How many miles?�

�From where to where, Your Majesty?�

�From D&#252;renstein to Krems.�

�Three and a half miles, Your Majesty.�

�Have the French abandoned the left bank?�

�According to the scouts� reports, the last of them crossed at night on rafts.�

�Is there enough forage in Krems?�

�Forage was not delivered in the quantities��

The emperor interrupted him:

�At what time was General Schmidt killed?�

�At seven o�clock, I believe.�

�At seven o�clock? Very sad! Very sad!�

The emperor said that he thanked him and inclined his head. Prince Andrei went out and was at once surrounded on all sides by courtiers. On all sides affectionate eyes looked at him and affectionate words came to him. Yesterday�s imperial adjutant reproached him for not staying in the palace, and offered him his own house. The minister of war came up to congratulate him on the Order of Maria Theresa of the third degree, which the emperor was to bestow on him. The empress�s chamberlain invited him to her majesty. The archduchess also wanted to see him. He did not know whom to answer and needed a few seconds to collect his wits. The Russian ambassador took him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and started talking to him.

Contrary to what Bilibin had said, the news he brought was received joyfully. A thanksgiving prayer service was ordered. Kutuzov was awarded a Maria Theresa with large cross, and the whole army received rewards. Bolkonsky received invitations from all sides and had to spend the whole morning paying visits to the high dignitaries of Austria. Having finished his visits past four in the afternoon, mentally composing a letter to his father about the battle and his journey to Br&#252;nn, Prince Andrei was returning home to Bilibin�s. Before going to Bilibin�s, Prince Andrei had gone to a bookstore to stock up on books for the campaign and had spent a long time there. By the porch of the house occupied by Bilibin stood a britzka half filled with things, and Franz, Bilibin�s servant, dragging a trunk with difficulty, came out the door.

�What�s this?� asked Bolkonsky.

�Ach, Erlaucht!� said Franz, loading the trunk into the britzka with difficulty. �Wir ziehen noch weiter. Der B&#246;sewicht ist schon wieder hinter uns her!�

�What is it? What?� Prince Andrei kept asking.

Bilibin came out to meet Bolkonsky. The usually calm face of Bilibin was troubled.

�Non, non, avouez que c�est charmant,� he was saying, �cette histoire du pont de Tabor� (a bridge in Vienna). �Ils l�ont pass&#233; sans coup f&#233;rir.�

Prince Andrei understood nothing.

�But where are you coming from that you don�t know what every coachman in town already knows?�

�I�m coming from the archduchess. I didn�t hear anything there.�

�And you didn�t see people packing up everywhere?�

�No, I didn�t�But what�s it all about?� Prince Andrei asked impatiently.

�What�s it all about? It�s about the French having crossed the bridge defended by Auersperg, and the bridge wasn�t blown up, so Murat is now racing down the road to Br&#252;nn, and they�ll be here today or tomorrow.�

�What do you mean, here? How is it they didn�t blow up the bridge, since it�s mined?�

�That�s what I�m asking. Nobody knows, not even Bonaparte himself.�

Bolkonsky shrugged his shoulders.

�But if the bridge has been crossed, that means the army is lost: it will be cut off,� he said.

�That�s just the thing,� answered Bilibin. �Listen. The French enter Vienna, as I said. Everything�s fine. The next day, that is, yesterday, the gentlemen marshals, Murat, Lannes, and Belliard, get on their horses and set out for the bridge. (Note that all three are Gascons.) �Gentlemen,� says one, �you know that the bridge of Thabor has been mined and countermined, and that in front of it is a terrible t&#234;te de pont and fifteen thousand troops, who have been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us onto it. But it will be pleasing to our sovereign emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge. Let�s go the three of us and take the bridge.� �Let�s go,� say the others; and they go and take the bridge, cross it, and are now on this side of the Danube with their whole army, coming against us, against you and your communications.�

�Enough joking,� Prince Andrei said sadly and seriously.

This news was grievous and at the same time pleasant for Prince Andrei. As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless situation, it occurred to him that it was precisely he who was destined to lead the Russian army out of that situation, that here was that Toulon which would take him out of the ranks of unknown officers and open for him the first path to glory! Listening to Bilibin, he was already considering how, on coming to the army, he would submit an opinion at the military council which alone would save the army, and how he alone would be charged with carrying out this plan.

�Enough joking,� he said.

�I�m not joking,� Bilibin went on, �nothing is more true or sad. These gentlemen come to the bridge by themselves and wave white handkerchiefs; assure them all that a truce has been called and that they, the marshals, are coming to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. The officer on duty lets them into the t&#234;te de pont. They tell him a thousand Gascon absurdities: that the war is over, that the emperor Franz has fixed a meeting with Bonaparte, that they wish to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, joke, sit on the cannons, and meanwhile a French battalion gets onto the bridge unnoticed, throws the sacks of flammable material into the water, and approaches the t&#234;te de pont. Finally, the lieutenant general himself comes, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern. �Our dear enemy! Flower of the Austrian military, hero of the Turkish wars! The hostilities are over, we can shake hands with each other�The emperor Napoleon is burning with desire to meet Prince Auersperg.� In short, these men aren�t Gascons for nothing, they so shower Auersperg with beautiful words, he�s so charmed by his quickly established intimacy with the French marshals, so dazzled by the sight of Murat�s mantle and ostrich feathers, qu�il n�y voit que du feu, et oublie celui qu�il devait faire, faire sur l�ennemi.� (Despite the animation of his speech, Bilibin did not forget to pause after this mot, to allow time for it to be appreciated.) �The French battalion rushes into the t&#234;te de pont, spikes the cannons, and the bridge is taken. No, but the best thing of all,� he went on, his excitement with his own charming story subsiding, �is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon that was to give the signal to ignite the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that French troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes pushed his hand away. The sergeant, who was clearly smarter than his general, goes up to Auersperg and says: �Prince, you are deceived, the French are here!� Murat sees that the game is up if the sergeant is allowed to speak. With feigned astonishment (a real Gascon), he turns to Auersperg: �Where is that Austrian discipline the world praises so much,� he says, �if you allow the lower ranks to speak to you like that.� C�est g&#233;nial. Le prince Auersperg se pique d�honneur et fait mettre le sergeant aux arr&#234;ts. Non, mais avouez que c�est charmant toute cette histoire du pont de Tabor. Ce n�est ni b&#234;tise, ni l&#226;chet&#233;��

�C�est trahison peut-&#234;tre,� said Prince Andrei, vividly imagining gray greatcoats, wounds, gunsmoke, the sounds of shooting, and the glory that awaited him�

�Non plus. Cela met la cour dans de trop mauvais draps,� Bilibin went on. �Ce n�est ni trahison, ni l&#226;chet&#233;, ni b&#234;tise; c�est comme &#224; Ulm�� It was as if he fell to pondering, searching for a phrase: �C�est�c�est du Mack. Nous somme mack&#233;s,� he concluded, feeling that he had uttered a mot, and a fresh mot, a mot that would be repeated.

The folds on his forehead, gathered till then, quickly released themselves as a sign of satisfaction, and, smiling slightly, he began to examine his nails.

�Where are you going?� he said suddenly, turning to Prince Andrei, who got up and made for his room.

�I�m leaving.�

�For where?�

�The army.�

�Why, didn�t you want to stay another two days?�

�But now I�m leaving at once.�

And Prince Andrei, having given orders for his departure, left for his room.

�You know what, my dear,� said Bilibin, coming into his room, �I�ve been thinking about you. Why should you go?�

And in proof of the irrefutability of his argument, all the folds fled his face.

Prince Andrei looked at his interlocutor questioningly and said nothing.

�Why should you go? I know, you think it�s your duty to gallop off to the army, now that the army is in danger. I understand that, mon cher, c�est de l�h&#233;roisme.�

�Not in the least,� said Prince Andrei.

�But you are un philosophe, so be one fully, look at things from another angle, and you�ll see that your duty is, on the contrary, to protect yourself. Let others, who are good for nothing else, do that�You weren�t told to come back, and you haven�t been dismissed from here; therefore you can stay and come with us wherever our sorry fate takes us. They say they�re going to Olm&#252;tz. Now, Olm&#252;tz is a very nice town. And you and I can calmly drive there together in my carriage.�

�Stop joking, Bilibin,� said Bolkonsky.

�I�m saying it to you sincerely as a friend. Consider. Where will you go now, and what for, when you can stay here? One of two things awaits you� (he gathered the skin over his left temple): �either peace will be concluded before you reach the army, or it will be defeat and disgrace along with the whole of Kutuzov�s army.�

And Bilibin released the skin, feeling that his dilemma was irrefutable.

�I cannot consider that,� Prince Andrei said coldly, and thought: �I�m going in order to save the army.�

�Mon cher, vous &#234;tes un h&#233;ros,� said Bilibin.


XIII

That same night, having repectfully taken leave of the minister of war, Bolkonsky rode off to the army, not knowing himself where he would find it and fearing to be intercepted by the French on his way to Krems.

In Br&#252;nn all the court population was packing, and the heavy baggage had already been sent to Olm&#252;tz. Near Etzelsdorf Prince Andrei came out on the road along which the Russian army was moving with the greatest haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was so choked with wagons that it was impossible to drive in a carriage. Having taken a horse and a Cossack from the chief of the Cossacks, Prince Andrei, hungry and tired, got ahead of the baggage train, going in search of the commander in chief and his own wagon. The most sinister rumors about the army�s situation had reached him on the way, and the sight of the feverishly fleeing army confirmed those rumors.

�Cette arm&#233;e Russe que l�or de l�Angleterre a transport&#233;e des extr&#233;mit&#233;s de l�univers, nous allons lui faire &#233;prouver le m&#234;me sort (le sort de l�arm&#233;e d�Ulm)� �he recalled the words of Napoleon�s order to his army before the start of the campaign, and these words aroused in him at once an astonishment at the genius of the hero, a feeling of offended pride, and a hope of glory. �And what if there�s nothing left but to die?� he thought. �Why not, if need be! I�ll do it no worse than others.�

Prince Andrei looked with scorn at these countless mixed-up detachments, wagons, caissons, artillery, and again wagons, wagons of all possible sorts, trying to get ahead of each other and choking the muddy road three or four abreast. On all sides, behind and before, as far as hearing could reach, there was the noise of wheels, the rumbling of flatbeds, carts, and gun carriages, the thud of hooves, the crack of whips, the shouts of drivers, the cursing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers. On the roadsides one constantly saw now dead horses, skinned or unskinned, now broken-down wagons, near which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something, now soldiers who separated from their detachments and went in groups to the neighboring villages or came from the villages dragging chickens, sheep, hay, or sacks filled with something. On the ascents and descents the crowds became thicker, and there was a ceaseless moan of cries. Soldiers, sunk in mud up to their knees, carried cannon and wagons with their hands; whips lashed, hooves slipped, traces snapped, and chests strained with shouting. The officers in charge of the movement rode up and down among the trains. Their voices were faintly heard amidst the general hubbub, and one could see from their faces that they despaired of the possibility of stopping this disorder.

�Voil&#224; le cher Orthodox armed forces,� thought Bolkonsky, recalling Bilibin�s words.

Wishing to ask someone among these people where the commander in chief was, he rode up to the baggage train. Directly in front of him rolled a strange one-horse vehicle, evidently constructed by soldiers using homegrown means, something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a carriage. The driver of the vehicle was a soldier, and in it, under a leather top and apron, sat a woman all wrapped in shawls. Prince Andrei rode up and was about to address the soldier with his question when his attention was attracted by the desperate cries of the woman sitting in the little kibitka. The officer in charge of the baggage train was beating the soldier who sat on the box of this little carriage for trying to get ahead of the others, and his lash struck the apron of the vehicle. The woman cried out piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrei, she thrust her head out from under the apron and, waving her thin arms freed from the ruglike shawl, cried:

�Adjutant! Mister Adjutant!�For God�s sake�protect us�What�s it all about?�I�m the wife of the doctor of the seventh chasseurs�they won�t let us pass; we couldn�t keep up, lost our people��

�I�ll flatten you like a pancake�turn back!� the officer shouted angrily at the soldier. �Turn back with your trollop!�

�Mister Adjutant, protect us. What is it?� cried the doctor�s wife.

�Kindly let this wagon pass. Don�t you see it�s a woman?� said Prince Andrei, riding up to the officer.

The officer glanced at him and, without replying, turned back to the soldier:

�I�ll teach you to go ahead�Back!�

�Let them pass, I tell you,� Prince Andrei repeated, pressing his lips.

�And who do you think you are?� the officer addressed him with drunken rage. �Who do you think you are? Are you� (he especially emphasized the word you) �a superior officer, or what? I�m the superior here, not you. And you, back!� he repeated, �or I�ll flatten you like a pancake.�

The officer obviously liked the expression.

�He told that little adjutant off grandly,� a voice came from behind.

Prince Andrei could see that the officer was in the sort of drunken fit of senseless rage when people do not know what they are saying. He could see that his intercession for the doctor�s wife in the kibitka was replete with what he feared most in the world, with what is known as ridicule. But his instinct told him otherwise. Before the officer had time to finish his last words, Prince Andrei, his face disfigured with rage, rode up to him and raised his whip:

�Kind-ly-let-them-pass!�

The officer waved his hand and hastily rode off.

�It�s all from them, these staff officers, all this disorder,� he grumbled. �Do it your way.�

Prince Andrei, without raising his eyes, hastily rode away from the doctor�s wife, who was calling him her savior, and, recalling with disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene, rode on towards the village where he had been told the commander in chief was.

On entering the village, he got off his horse and went to the first house, intending to rest for at least a moment, eat something, and bring clarity to all these insulting, tormenting thoughts. �These are not troops, they�re a mob of ruffians,� he was thinking as he went to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called his name.

He turned around. Nesvitsky�s handsome face was looking out of a small window. Nesvitsky, chewing something with his juicy mouth and waving his arms, was calling to him.

�Bolkonsky, Bolkonsky! Are you deaf, or what? Come quickly,� he shouted.

Going into the house, Prince Andrei saw Nesvitsky and another adjutant having something to eat. They hastily turned to Bolkonsky with the question whether he had any fresh news. On their familiar faces Prince Andrei read the expression of alarm and anxiety. This expression was especially noticeable on the always laughing face of Nesvitsky.

�Where�s the commander in chief?� asked Bolkonsky.

�Here, in that house,� the adjutant replied.

�Well, so, is it true there�s peace and capitulation?� asked Nesvitsky.

�I was going to ask you. I know nothing except that I had a hard time getting to you.�

�And what�s going on with us, brother! Terrible! I confess, brother, we laughed at Mack, and yet it�s going much worse for us,� said Nesvitsky. �But sit down, eat something.�

�Now, Prince, you�ll find no wagons, nothing, and God knows where your Pyotr is,� said the other adjutant.

�Where are headquarters?�

�We�ll spend the night in Znaim.�

�What I did was repack everything I need onto two horses,� said Nesvitsky, �and I had excellent packs made for me. I could skip off over the Bohemian Mountains now. It�s bad, brother. But you�re surely unwell, the way you�re shivering?� asked Nesvitsky, noticing how Prince Andrei twitched as if he had touched a Leiden jar.

�It�s nothing,� replied Prince Andrei.

He had just recalled his recent encounter with the doctor�s wife and the convoy officer.

�What is the commander in chief doing here?� he asked.

�I understand nothing,� said Nesvitsky.

�I understand one thing, that it�s all vile, vile, vile,� said Prince Andrei, and he went to the house where the commander in chief was staying.

Going past Kutuzov�s carriage, the winded riding horses of the suite, and the Cossacks talking loudly among themselves, Prince Andrei came to the entryway. Kutuzov himself, as Prince Andrei was told, was inside the cottage with Prince Bagration and Weyrother. Weyrother was an Austrian general who had replaced the slain Schmidt. In the entryway, little Kozlovsky was crouching in front of a scribe. The scribe, the cuffs of his tunic turned up, was writing hurriedly on an overturned tub. Kozlovsky�s face looked exhausted�obviously he also had not slept that night. He glanced at Prince Andrei and did not even nod to him.

�Second line�Have you written that?� he went on dictating to the scribe. �The Kievsky grenadiers, the Podolsky��

�Don�t rush, Your Honor,� the scribe replied disrespectfully and crossly, looking up at Kozlovsky.

From behind the door just then came the animated and displeased voice of Kutuzov, interrupted by another, unknown voice. From the sound of that voice, from the inattention with which Kozlovsky had glanced at him, from the disrespectfulness of the exhausted scribe, from the fact that the scribe and Kozlovsky were sitting so close to the commander in chief on the floor by the tub, and from the fact that the Cossacks who tended the horses were laughing loudly outside the window�from all that Prince Andrei could feel that something grave and unfortunate must be happening.

Prince Andrei plied Kozlovsky with insistent questions.

�One moment, Prince,� said Kozlovsky. �A disposition for Bagration.�

�And capitulation?�

�Nothing of the sort; orders have been issued for battle.�

Prince Andrei went to the door, behind which voices could be heard. But just as he was about to open the door, the voices in the room fell silent, the door opened by itself, and Kutuzov, with his eagle�s beak on his plump face, appeared in the doorway. Prince Andrei was standing directly in front of Kutuzov; but from the expression in the commander in chief�s one good eye, it was clear that his thoughts and concerns occupied him so greatly that it was as if they interfered with his vision. He looked directly at his adjutant�s face and did not recognize him.

�Well, what, are you finished?� he addressed Kozlovsky.

�This second, Your Excellency.�

Bagration, of medium height, with a firm and immobile face of the Oriental type, dry, not yet an old man, came out after the commander in chief.

�I have the honor of reporting to you,� Prince Andrei repeated quite loudly, handing him an envelope.

�Ah, from Vienna? Very well. Later, later!�

Kutuzov and Bagration stepped out to the porch.

�Well, good-bye, Prince,� he said to Bagration. �Christ be with you. I bless you for a great deed.�

Kutuzov�s face suddenly softened, and tears welled up in his eyes. He pulled Bagration to him with his left hand, and with his right, which had a ring on it, making an obviously habitual gesture, crossed him and offered him his plump cheek, instead of which Bagration kissed him on the neck.

�Christ be with you!� Kutuzov repeated and went to his carriage. �Get in with me,� he said to Bolkonsky.

�Your Excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to stay in Prince Bagration�s detachment.�

�Get in,� said Kutuzov, and noticing that Bolkonsky hung back, said: �I need good officers myself.�

They got into the carriage and rode for several minutes in silence.

�There is still much before us, much of everything,� he said, with an old man�s perceptive expression, as though he understood everything that was going on in Bolkonsky�s soul. �If one tenth of his detachment comes back tomorrow, I�ll thank God,� Kutuzov added, as if speaking to himself.

Prince Andrei looked at Kutuzov and his eyes were involuntarily struck by the carefully washed creases of the scar on Kutuzov�s temple, a foot away from him, where the Izmail bullet had pierced his head and put out his eye. �Yes, he has the right to speak so calmly about the deaths of these people!� thought Bolkonsky.

�That is why I am asking you to send me to that detachment,� he said.

Kutuzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had said, and sat deep in thought. After five minutes, rocking smoothly on the soft springs of the carriage, Kutuzov turned to Prince Andrei. There was no trace of emotion on his face. With fine irony he questioned the prince about the details of his meeting with the emperor, about the opinions he had heard at court concerning the action at Krems, and about several women of their mutual acquaintance.


XIV

On the first of November Kutuzov received information through one of his scouts that placed the army he commanded in an almost hopeless position. The scout had reported that the French in enormous force, having crossed the bridge in Vienna, were heading towards Kutuzov�s line of communications with the troops coming from Russia. If Kutuzov decided to stay in Krems, the one-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-man army of Napoleon would cut him off from all communications, surround his exhausted forty-thousand-man army, and he would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If Kutuzov decided to abandon the road leading to communications with the troops from Russia, he would have to enter with no road into the unknown territory of the Bohemian Mountains, defending himself from the superior numbers of the enemy, and abandoning any hope of communications with Buxh&#246;wden. If Kutuzov decided to retreat down the road from Krems to Olm&#252;tz to unite with the troops from Russia, he would risk being forestalled on that road by the French, who had crossed the bridge in Vienna, and thus being forced to accept battle on the march, with all his heavy baggage and transport, and to deal with an enemy that outnumbered him three to one and surrounded him on both sides.

Kutuzov chose this last course.

The French, as the scout reported, had crossed the bridge in Vienna and by forced marches were making for Znaim, which lay on the path of Kutuzov�s retreat, more than sixty miles ahead of him. To reach Znaim before the French meant to gain great hope of saving the army; to let the French forestall them in Znaim meant certainly to subject the whole army to a disgrace similar to that at Ulm, or to total destruction. To forestall the French with his entire army was impossible. The road from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the Russians� road from Krems to Znaim.

The night he received this information, Kutuzov sent Bagration�s four-thousand-man vanguard to the right over the hills from the Krems�Znaim to the Vienna�Znaim road. Bagration was to make this march without resting, to stop with his face to Vienna and his back to Znaim, and, if he managed to forestall the French, to detain them there as long as he could. Kutuzov himself started out for Znaim with all the heavy baggage.

Having gone thirty miles across the hills with hungry, ill-shod soldiers, with no road, on a stormy night, losing a third of his men as stragglers, Bagration came out in Hollabrunn, on the Vienna�Znaim road, several hours ahead of the French, who were approaching Hollabrunn from Vienna. Kutuzov still needed to go a whole twenty-four hours with his baggage train to reach Znaim, and therefore, to save the army, Bagration, with four thousand hungry, exhausted soldiers, had to hold off for twenty-four hours the entire enemy army coming to meet him at Hollabrunn, which was obviously impossible. But a freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick which gave the Vienna bridge into the hands of the French without a fight prompted Murat to try to trick Kutuzov in the same way. Murat, meeting Bagration�s weak detachment on the Znaim road, thought it was the whole of Kutuzov�s army. In order to crush this army indubitably, he awaited the troops that lagged behind on the road from Vienna, and with that aim suggested a three-day truce, on condition that neither army change its position or stir from its place. Murat assured them that peace negotiations were already under way and that therefore, to avoid useless bloodshed, he was suggesting a truce. The Austrian general, Count Nostitz, who occupied the advance posts, believed the words of Murat�s envoy and fell back, exposing Bagration�s detachment. Another envoy rode to the Russian line to announce the same news of peace negotiations and offer the Russian army a three-day truce. Bagration replied that he could neither accept nor reject a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutuzov with a report of the offer made to him.

For Kutuzov the truce was the sole means of gaining time, giving Bagration�s exhausted detachment some rest, and allowing the train and heavy baggage (whose movement was concealed from the French) to make at least one extra march towards Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the sole and unexpected possibility of saving the army. On receiving this news, Kutuzov immediately sent the adjutant general Wintzingerode, who was attached to him, to the enemy camp. Wintzingerode was not only to accept the truce, but also to offer conditions for capitulation, and meanwhile Kutuzov sent his adjutants back to speed up as much as possible the movement of the whole army�s baggage trains along the Krems�Znaim road. Bagration�s exhausted, hungry detachment, covering this movement of the baggage trains and the whole army, had alone to remain unmoving before an enemy eight times its strength.

Kutuzov�s expectations came true both with regard to the fact that the offer of capitulation, without committing them to anything, might gain time for some portion of the baggage train to pass, and with regard to the fact that Murat�s mistake was bound to be discovered very quickly. As soon as Bonaparte, who was in Sch&#246;nbrunn, some fifteen miles from Hollabrunn, received Murat�s communication with the project of a truce and capitulation, he saw through the deception and wrote the following letter to Murat.

Au Prince Murat.


 Schoenbrunn, 25 brumaire en 1805


 &#224; huit heures du matin.

Il m�est impossible de trouver des termes pour vous exprimer mon m&#233;contentement. Vous ne commandez que mon avant-garde et vous n�avez pas le droit de faire d�armistice sans mon ordre. Vous me faites perdre le fruit d�une campagne. Rompez l�armistice sur-le-champ et marchez &#224; l�ennemi. Vous lui ferez d&#233;clarer, que le g&#233;n&#233;ral qui a sign&#233; cette capitulation, n�avait pas le droit de le faire, qu�il n�y a que l�Empereur de Russie qui ait ce droit.

Toutes les fois cependant que l�Empereur de Russie ratifierait la dite convention, je la ratifierai; mais ce n�est q�une ruse. Marchez, d&#233;truisez l�arm&#233;e russe�vous &#234;tes en position de prendre son bagage et son artillerie.

L�aide-de-camp de l�Empereur de Russie est un�Les officiers ne sont rien quand ils n�ont pas de pouvoirs: celui-ci n�en avait point�Les Autrichiens se sont laiss&#233; jouer pour le passage du pont de Vienne, vous vous laissez jouer par un aide-de-camp de l�Empereur.

Napol&#233;on.

Bonaparte�s adjutant galloped off at full speed with this threatening letter to Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting his generals, moved with all his guards to the field of battle, fearing to let the ready victim slip, while Bagration�s four-thousand-man division cheerfully lit campfires, dried out, warmed up, cooked kasha for the first time in three days, and not one man in the division knew or thought about what lay ahead of him.


XV

It was past three o�clock in the afternoon when Prince Andrei, who had persuaded Kutuzov to grant his request, arrived in Grunt and went to Bagration. Bonaparte�s adjutant had not yet reached Murat�s division, and the battle had not yet begun. In Bagration�s division, nothing was known about the general course of affairs; they talked of peace, but did not believe in its possibility. They talked of battle and also did not believe in the nearness of battle.

Bagration, knowing Bolkonsky to be a favorite and trusted adjutant, received him with a superior officer�s special distinction and indulgence, explained to him that there would probably be a battle that day or the next, and allowed him full freedom to stay by him during the battle or to supervise the order of retreat in the rear guard, �which was also very important.�

�However, there will probably be no action today,� said Bagration, as if to soothe Prince Andrei.

�If he�s one of those ordinary staff dandies sent to earn himself a little cross, he can earn it just as well in the rear guard, but if he wants to be with me, let him�he�ll be useful, if he�s a brave officer,� thought Bagration. Prince Andrei, having said nothing, asked permission to go around the lines and learn the disposition of the forces, so as to know where to go in case of an errand. The officer on duty in the detachment, a handsome man, foppishly dressed and with a diamond ring on his index finger, who spoke French poorly but eagerly, volunteered to accompany Prince Andrei.

On all sides one saw wet, sad-faced officers, who seemed to be looking for something, and soldiers, who were dragging doors, benches, and fences from the village.

�You see, Prince, we can�t rid ourselves of these folk,� said the staff officer, pointing to them. �The commanders neglect discipline. And here,� he pointed to a sutler�s tent, �they crowd in and sit. This morning I drove them all out: look, it�s full again. We must ride over, Prince, and scare them away. For a moment.�

�Let�s go in. I�ll have some bread and cheese,� said Prince Andrei, who had not yet had time to eat.

�Why didn�t you tell me, Prince? I�d have offered you my hospitality.�

They dismounted and went into the sutler�s tent. Several officers with flushed and languorous faces were sitting at tables eating and drinking.

�Well, what is this, gentlemen?� the staff officer said in a tone of reproach, like a man who has already repeated the same thing several times. �You can�t absent yourselves like this. The prince ordered that nobody should be found here. Well, take you, Mister Staff Captain,� he addressed a small, dirty, thin artillery officer, who was standing bootless before the entering men (he had given his boots to the sutler to dry), just in his stockings, smiling not quite naturally.

�Well, Captain Tushin, aren�t you ashamed?� the staff officer went on. �It would seem that you, as an artillerist, ought to set an example, and here you are bootless. They�ll sound the alarm, and a fine one you�ll be with no boots on.� (The staff officer smiled.) �Kindly go back to your posts, gentlemen�all, all of you,� he added in a superior�s tone.

Prince Andrei smiled involuntarily, looking at Captain Tushin. Silent and smiling, Tushin shifted from one bare foot to the other, and looked questioningly with his large, intelligent and kindly eyes first at Prince Andrei, then at the staff officer.

�Soldiers say it�s nimbler barefoot,� said Captain Tushin with a timorous smile, evidently wishing to turn his awkward position into a joke.

But before he finished, he felt that his joke was unsuccessful and had not gone over. He became embarrassed.

�Kindly go,� said the staff officer, trying to maintain his seriousness.

Prince Andrei looked once more at the little figure of the artillerist. There was something special in it, totally unmilitary, slightly comical, but extremely attractive.

The staff officer and Prince Andrei got on their horses and rode further.

Having left the village, constantly meeting and going ahead of walking soldiers, officers of various detachments, they saw to their left the reddish, fresh, newly dug clay of the fortification under construction. Several battalions of soldiers in nothing but their shirts, despite the cold wind, were swarming like white ants over this fortification; someone invisible kept shoveling out red clay from behind the rampart. They rode up to the fortification, examined it, and rode on. Just behind the fortification they ran into several dozen soldiers, constantly replacing each other, running down the rampart. They had to hold their noses and set their horses at a trot to get away from that poisoned atmosphere.

�Voil&#224; l�agr&#233;ment des camps, monsieur le prince,� said the staff officer on duty.

They rode to the opposite hill. From this hill they could already see the French. Prince Andrei stopped and began to examine.

�Here�s where our battery stands,� said the staff officer, indicating the highest point, �the one of that odd bird who was sitting there without boots. You can see everything from there: let�s go, Prince.�

�I humbly thank you, I�ll go by myself now,� said Prince Andrei, wishing to rid himself of the staff officer, �don�t trouble yourself, please.�

The staff officer stayed behind, and Prince Andrei rode on alone.

The further ahead he moved, the closer to the enemy, the more orderly and cheerful the troops looked. The greatest disorder and despondency had been in that baggage train before Znaim, which Prince Andrei had circled around in the morning, and which was some seven miles away from the French. In Grunt there was also a feeling of a certain alarm and fear of something. But the closer Prince Andrei rode to the French line, the more self-assured our troops looked. Lined up in ranks, the soldiers stood in their greatcoats, and a sergeant major and a company commander counted heads, jabbing a finger towards the last soldier in the row and ordering him to raise his hand; scattered all over the area, soldiers were carrying firewood and brushwood and building little lean-tos, laughing merrily and talking among themselves; some sat by the campfires, dressed or naked, drying their shirts and foot cloths, or mending boots and greatcoats, crowding around the cauldrons and cooks. In one company, dinner was ready, and the soldiers looked greedily at the steaming cauldrons, waiting until an officer who was sitting on a log facing his lean-to had tried the kasha brought to him in a wooden bowl by a quartermaster sergeant.

In another, more fortunate company, since not all of them had vodka, soldiers crowded around a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major, who, tipping a keg, poured into the canteen caps that the soldiers held out in turn. The soldiers, with pious faces, brought the caps to their mouths, upended them, and, rinsing their mouths and wiping them on their greatcoat sleeves, walked away from the sergeant major with cheered faces. All the faces were as calm as though everything was happening not in view of the enemy, prior to an action in which at least half the division would be left on the field, but somewhere in their home country, in expectation of a peaceful stay. Having passed the regiment of chasseurs, and through the lines of the Kievsky grenadiers�brave folk, occupied with the same peaceful affairs�Prince Andrei drew near the tall lean-to, unlike the others, of the regimental commander, and came out to a lined-up platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a stripped man. Two soldiers were holding him, and two, swinging supple switches, were beating him rhythmically on his stripped back. The punished man was crying out unnaturally. A fat major walked in front of the line and, paying no attention to the cries, ceaselessly repeated:

�It is a disgrace for a soldier to steal, a soldier should be honest, noble, and brave; and if one steals from his comrade, there is no honor in him, he is a scoundrel. More, more!�

Again there came the supple strokes and a desperate but feigned cry.

�More, more,� repeated the major.

A young officer, with an expression of perplexity and suffering on his face, walked away from the punished man, looking questioningly at the passing adjutant.

Prince Andrei, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our line and the enemy�s stood far from each other on the left and right flanks, but in the center, where the envoys had passed that morning, the lines came so close that the men could see each other�s faces and talk to each other. Besides the soldiers who occupied the line at that place, many of the curious stood on both sides and gazed, laughing, at their strange and foreign-looking enemies.

Since early morning, though it was forbidden to go near the line, the officers had been unable to ward off the curious. The soldiers stationed on the line, like people displaying something rare, no longer looked at the French, but made their observations to those who came and, languishing, waited to be relieved. Prince Andrei stopped to examine the French.

�Look, look,� one soldier said to his comrade, pointing to a Russian musketeer who had gone up to the line along with an officer and was speaking rapidly and heatedly with a French grenadier. �See how clever he patters away. Even the Khrenchman can�t keep up with him. Now you, Sidorov��

�Wait, listen. That�s really clever!� replied Sidorov, who was considered an expert at speaking French.

The soldier at whom the laughing men were pointing was Dolokhov. Prince Andrei recognized him and listened to what he was saying. Dolokhov and his company commander had come to the line from the left flank, where their regiment was stationed.

�Go on, more, more!� the company commander egged him on, leaning forward and trying not to miss a single incomprehensible word. �Thicker and faster! What�s he saying?�

Dolokhov did not answer his company commander; he was involved in a heated argument with the French grenadier. They were talking, as they could only have been, about the campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, insisted that the Russians had surrendered and fled all the way from Ulm. Dolokhov insisted that the Russians had not surrendered, but had beaten the French.

�We have orders to drive you away, and that�s what we�re going to do,� said Dolokhov.

�Only try hard not to get captured with all your Cossacks,� said the French grenadier.

The French onlookers and listeners laughed.

�We�ll make you dance, as you danced for Suvorov� (on vous fera danser), said Dolokhov.

�Qu�est-ce qu�il chante?� said one Frenchman.

�De l�histoire ancienne,� said a third, realizing that the talk was about former wars. �L�Empereur va lui faire voir &#224; votre Souvara, comme les autres��

�Bonaparte�� Dolokhov began, but the Frenchman interrupted him.

�There is no Bonaparte. There is the Emperor! Sacr&#233; nom�� he cried angrily.

�Devil take your emperor!�

And Dolokhov produced a rude soldier�s curse and, shouldering his gun, walked off.

�Come on, Ivan Lukich,� he said to the company commander.

�That�s the Khrench for you,� the soldiers started talking in the line. �Now you, Sidorov!�

Sidorov winked and, turning to the French, began pouring out a thick patter of incomprehensible words:

�Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, kask&#224;,� he pattered, trying to give his voice expressive intonations.

�Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Hoo, hoo!� Peals of such healthy and merry guffawing came from among the soldiers that it crossed the line and involuntarily infected the French, after which it seemed they ought quickly to unload their guns, blow up their munitions, and all quickly go back home.

But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in the houses and fortifications looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon remained turned against each other just as before.


XVI

Having ridden all along the line of troops from the right flank to the left, Prince Andrei went up to the battery, from which, according to the staff officer�s words, one could see the whole field. Here he got off his horse and stopped by the last of the four unlimbered cannon. In front of the cannon paced an artillery sentry, who snapped to attention before the officer, but at a sign from him renewed his measured, tedious pacing. Behind the cannon stood their limbers, further behind a hitching rail and the campfires of the artillerists. To the left, not far from the last cannon, there was a newly plaited lean-to from which came the animated voices of the officers.

Indeed, from the battery a view opened out of almost the entire disposition of the Russian troops and the greater part of the enemy�s. Directly facing the battery, on the crest of the knoll opposite, one could see the village of Sch&#246;ngraben; to left and right it was possible to make out in three places amidst the smoke of their campfires the masses of the French troops, of whom the greater part were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill. To the left of the village, in the smoke, appeared something resembling a battery, but it was impossible to see it well with the naked eye. Our right flank was disposed on a rather steep elevation, which dominated the positions of the French. On it our infantry was disposed, and at the very end one could see the dragoons. In the center, where Tushin�s battery stood, from where Prince Andrei was surveying the position, there was a gently sloping and direct descent and ascent to the stream that separated us from Sch&#246;ngraben. To the left our troops adjoined a woods, where smoked the campfires of our infantry, who were cutting firewood. The French line was wider than ours, and it was obvious that the French could easily encircle us from both sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep ravine, through which it would be hard for artillery and cavalry to retreat. Prince Andrei, leaning his elbow on the cannon and taking out his notebook, drew a plan of the disposition of the troops for himself. In two places he penciled some notes, intending to tell Bagration about them. He proposed, first, to concentrate all the artillery in the center; second, to transfer the cavalry back to the other side of the ravine. Prince Andrei had been constantly at the commander in chief�s side, had followed the movements of masses and the general orders, and had constantly been taken up with historical descriptions of battles, and in this forthcoming action involuntarily considered the future course of the military operations only in general terms. He pictured only major occurrences of the following kind: �If the enemy mounts an attack on the right flank,� he said to himself, �the Kievsky grenadiers and the Podolsky chasseurs will have to hold their positions until reserves from the center reach them. In that case, the dragoons can strike at the flank and overthrow them. In case of an attack on the center, we can deploy the central battery on this elevation, and under its cover pull back the left flank and retreat into the ravine by echelons,� he reasoned to himself�

All the while he was in the battery by the cannon, as often happens, he had never stopped hearing the sounds of the officers� voices, talking in the lean-to, but had not understood a single word of what they were saying. Suddenly the sound of voices from the lean-to struck him with such soul-felt tones that he involuntarily began to listen.

�No, dear heart,� spoke a pleasant voice, which seemed familiar to Prince Andrei, �I say that if it were possible to know what there will be after death, none of us would be afraid of death. That�s so, dear heart.�

Another, younger voice interrupted him:

�Afraid or not, all the same you can�t avoid it.�

�But you�re still afraid! Eh, you learned people,� said a third, manly voice, interrupting the two others. �That�s why you artillerists are so learned, because you can tote everything along with you, both vodka and grub.�

And the owner of the manly voice, probably an infantry officer, laughed.

�But you�re still afraid,� the first, familiar voice went on. �Afraid of the unknown, that�s what. However much we say that the soul will go to heaven�we know that there is no heaven, but only atmosphere.�

Again the manly voice interrupted the artillerist.

�Well, let�s have some of your herb liqueur, Tushin,� it said.

�Ah, it�s that same captain who stood without boots in the canteen,� thought Prince Andrei, glad to have identified the pleasant, philosophizing voice.

�Herb liqueur�s possible,� said Tushin, �but even so, to understand the future life�� He did not finish.

Just then a whistling was heard in the air; closer, closer, faster and louder, louder and faster, and a cannonball, as if not finishing all it had to say, crashed to the ground with inhuman force not far from the lean-to, throwing up a spray of dirt. The earth seemed to gasp from the terrible blow.

At that same moment little Tushin came running out of the lean-to ahead of everyone else, his pipe askew in his teeth; his kindly, intelligent face was slightly pale. After him the owner of the manly voice came out, a dashing infantry officer, and ran to his company, buttoning himself up as he ran.


XVII

Prince Andrei, mounted up, stayed at the battery, looking at the smoke of the cannon from which the cannonball had come flying. His eyes ran over the vast space. He saw only that the previously immobile masses of the French began to sway, and that there was indeed a battery to the left. The smoke there had not yet dispersed. Two French horsemen, probably adjutants, were galloping over the hill. A small column of the enemy, clearly visible, was moving down the hillside, probably to reinforce the line. The smoke of the first shot had not scattered when another puff appeared, followed by a report. The battle had begun. Prince Andrei turned his horse and rode back to Grunt to look for Prince Bagration. Behind him he heard the cannonade growing louder and heavier. Evidently ours had begun to respond. Below, in the place where the envoys had passed, musketfire was heard.

Lemarrois had just come galloping to Murat with the menacing letter from Bonaparte, and the shamed Murat, wishing to smooth over his mistake, at once moved his troops up to the center and around both flanks, hoping before evening and the emperor�s arrival to crush the insignificant detachment that stood facing him.

�It�s begun! Here it is!� thought Prince Andrei, feeling the blood beginning to rush more quickly to his heart. �But where, then? How will my Toulon declare itself?� he thought.

Riding among the same companies that had been eating kasha and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour ago, he saw everywhere the same quick movements of soldiers lining up and taking their muskets, and on all faces he recognized the feeling of animation that was in his heart. �It�s begun! Here it is! Fearful and merry!� spoke the face of every soldier and officer.

Before he reached the still-unfinished fortification, he saw horsemen moving towards him in the evening light of the gray, autumnal day. The foremost, in a felt cloak and peaked astrakhan cap, was riding a white horse. It was Prince Bagration. Prince Andrei stopped to wait for him. Prince Bagration reined in his horse and, recognizing Prince Andrei, nodded to him. He went on looking ahead all the while Prince Andrei was telling him what he had seen.

The expression �It�s begun! Here it is!� was even on the firm, swarthy face of Prince Bagration, with its half-closed eyes, lackluster as if from want of sleep. Prince Andrei peered into that immobile face with anxious curiosity, and wished to know whether this man thought and felt, and what he thought and felt, at that moment. �Is there anything there behind that immobile face?� Prince Andrei asked himself, looking at him. Prince Bagration inclined his head as a sign of assent to Prince Andrei�s words, and said �Very good� with such an expression as if everything that was taking place and that had been reported to him was precisely what he had already foreseen. Prince Andrei, breathless from fast riding, spoke quickly. Prince Bagration pronounced words especially slowly with his Oriental accent, as if to suggest that they were not hurrying anywhere. Nevertheless, he started his horse at a trot towards Tushin�s battery. Prince Andrei and the suite followed behind him. Behind Prince Bagration rode an officer of the suite, the prince�s personal adjutant, Zherkov, an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty, on a handsome bobtailed horse, and a state councillor, an auditor, who had asked to come to the battle out of curiosity. The auditor, a plump man with a plump face and a na&#239;ve smile of joy, looked around him, jolting along on his horse, and made a strange sight in his camlet coat, on a goverment issue saddle, among the hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants.

�See, he wants to have a look at a battle,� Zherkov said to Bolkonsky, pointing to the auditor, �but he�s got a knot in the pit of his stomach.�

�Well, enough from you,� the auditor said with a beaming smile, na&#239;ve and at the same time sly, as if he was flattered to be the butt of Zherkov�s jokes, and as if he was deliberately trying to seem stupider than he really was.

�Tr&#232;s dr&#244;le, mon monsieur prince,� said the staff officer on duty. (He remembered that there was some special way of addressing a prince in French, but was unable to get it right.)

Just then they were all approaching Tushin�s battery, and a cannonball landed in front of them.

�What fell?� the auditor asked, smiling na&#239;vely.

�French pancakes,� said Zherkov.

�So that�s what they hit you with?� asked the auditor. �How frightful!�

And he seemed to melt all over with satisfaction. He had barely finished speaking when there again came an unexpected, dreadful whistle, suddenly ending in a thud against something liquid, and f-f-flop�a Cossack, riding a little to the right and behind the auditor, crashed to the ground with his horse. Zherkov and the staff officer on duty crouched low to their saddles and turned their horses away. The auditor stopped in front of the Cossack, examining him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, the horse was still thrashing.

Prince Bagration, narrowing his eyes, turned to look and, seeing the cause of the confusion, looked away indifferently, as if saying: �Is it worth bothering with such stupidities?� He stopped his horse the way a good rider does, bent over a little, and straightened his sword, which had caught in his felt cloak. The sword was an old one, not the kind men wore now. Prince Andrei recalled the story of how Suvorov had made a gift of his sword to Bagration in Italy, and this recollection was especially pleasing to him at that moment. They rode up to the battery near which Bolkonsky had stood when he examined the battlefield.

�Whose company?� Prince Bagration asked a fireworker standing by the caissons.

He asked, �Whose company?� but essentially he was asking, �You�re not scared here, are you?� And the fireworker understood that.

�Captain Tushin�s, Your Excellency,� the red-haired, freckle-faced fireworker cried out in a merry voice, snapping to attention.

�So, so,� said Bagration, calculating something, and he rode past the limbers to the end cannon.

While he was on his way there, a shot rang out from that cannon, deafening him and his suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the cannon one could see the artillerists seize hold of it and, straining hurriedly, pull it back to its former place. The broad-shouldered, enormous soldier number one, with a swab in his hand, his legs spread wide, jumped over to the wheel. Number two was loading a charge into the muzzle with a trembling hand. A small, stooping man, the officer Tushin, stumbling over the trail, ran forward, not noticing the general and peering from under his small hand.

�Add two more notches and it�ll be just right,� he shouted in a high-pitched voice, trying to give it a dashing sound, which did not go with his little figure. �Number two,� he squeaked. �Smash �em, Medvedev!�

Bagration called to the officer, and Tushin went over to the general, putting three fingers to his visor in a timid and awkward movement, not as military men salute, but as priests bless. Though Tushin�s guns were meant to be shooting into the hollow, he was sending fireballs at the village of Sch&#246;ngraben visible straight ahead, before which large masses of French were moving forward.

No one had given Tushin any orders about where to shoot or with what, and, having consulted his sergeant major Zakharchenko, for whom he had great respect, he had decided that it would be good to set fire to the village. �Very good!� Bagration said to the officer�s report, and he began to survey the whole battlefield opened out before him, as if calculating something. On the right side the French had come nearest of all. Below the elevation on which the Kievsky regiment stood, in the river hollow, the soul-wrenching roll and crackle of musketfire could be heard, and much further to the right, beyond the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed out to the prince a column of the French turning our flank. To the left the horizon was limited by the neighboring woods. Prince Bagration ordered two battalions from the center to go as reinforcements to the right. The officer of the suite ventured to observe to the prince that, with those two battalions gone, the cannon would remain exposed. Prince Bagration turned to the officer of the suite and looked at him silently with his lackluster eyes. It seemed to Prince Andrei that the officer of the suite�s observation was correct and there was indeed nothing to say. But just then an adjutant came galloping from the regimental commander who was in the hollow with a report that huge masses of the French were coming from below, that the regiment was in disarray and was falling back towards the Kievsky grenadiers. Prince Bagration inclined his head as a sign of assent and approval. He rode to the right at a walk and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with an order to attack the French. But the adjutant sent there came back half an hour later with the report that the regimental commander of the dragoons had already pulled back beyond the ravine, because heavy fire had been directed at him and he had been losing men uselessly, and therefore he had dismounted his riflemen in the woods.

�Very good!� said Bagration.

As he was riding away from the battery, shots were also heard to the left, in the woods, and as it was too far from the left flank for him to get there in time himself, Prince Bagration sent Zherkov there to tell the senior general, the one who had presented the regiment to Kutuzov in Braunau, to pull back beyond the ravine as quickly as possible, because the right flank would probably be unable to hold the enemy for long. Tushin and the battalion covering him were forgotten. Prince Andrei listened carefully to Prince Bagration�s exchanges with the commanders and to the orders he gave, and noticed, to his surprise, that no orders were given, and that Prince Bagration only tried to pretend that all that was done by necessity, chance, or the will of a particular commander, that it was all done, if not on his orders, then in accord with his intentions. Owing to the tact shown by Prince Bagration, Prince Andrei noticed that, in spite of the chance character of events and their independence of the commander�s will, his presence accomplished a very great deal. Commanders who rode up to Prince Bagration with troubled faces became calm, soldiers and officers greeted him merrily and became more animated in his presence, and obviously showed off their courage before him.


XVIII

Prince Bagration, having ridden to the highest point on our right flank, started down to where rolling gunfire could be heard and nothing could be seen through the powder smoke. The further they descended into the hollow, the less they could see, but the more they could sense the nearness of the actual battlefield. They began to meet the wounded. One with a bloodied head, hatless, was being dragged under the arms by two soldiers. He gurgled and spat. The bullet seemed to have hit him in the mouth or the throat. Another came towards them, walking briskly by himself, without his musket, groaning loudly and waving his arm from the fresh pain, while blood poured over his greatcoat as if from a flask. His face showed more fear than suffering. He had been wounded a moment before. Crossing the road, they began a steep descent and on the slope saw several men who were lying down; they met a crowd of soldiers, some of whom were not wounded. The soldiers were walking up the hill, breathing heavily and, though they saw the general, were talking loudly and waving their arms. Ahead, in the smoke, lines of gray greatcoats could now be seen, and an officer, catching sight of Bagration, ran shouting after the soldiers walking in a crowd, demanding that they turn back. Bagration rode up to the lines, along which there was here and there a rapid crackle of gunfire, drowning out talk and shouts of command. The air was completely saturated with powder smoke. The soldiers� faces were all smudged with powder and animated. Some tamped down with ramrods, others primed the pans and took shot from their pouches, still others fired. But who they were firing at could not be seen owing to the smoke, which there was no wind to scatter. Pleasant buzzing and whistling noises were heard rather often. �What�s that?� thought Prince Andrei, riding up to the crowd of soldiers. �It can�t be a line, because they�re in a bunch! It can�t be an attack, because they�re not moving; it can�t be a square: they�re not standing right.�

A lean, weak-looking old man, a regimental commander, with a pleasant smile, with eyelids that more than half covered his old man�s eyes, giving him a meek look, rode up to Prince Bagration and received him as a host receives a welcome guest. He reported to Prince Bagration that the French had mounted a cavalry attack against his regiment, and that, while the attack had been beaten off, the regiment had lost more than half its men. The regimental commander said that the attack had been beaten off, coming up with this military term to describe what had happened in his regiment; but in reality he did not know himself what had happened in that half hour among the troops entrusted to him, and he could not say for certain whether the attack had been beaten off or his regiment had been crushed by the attack. At the start of the action he knew only that cannonballs and shells began flying all over his regiment and hitting people, that someone then shouted, �Cavalry!� and our men began to fire. And they were still firing, no longer at the cavalry, who had disappeared, but at the French infantry who had appeared in the hollow and were shooting at our men. Prince Bagration inclined his head as a sign that this was all exactly as he had wished and supposed. Turning to the adjutant, he ordered him to bring down from the hill two battalions of the sixth chasseurs, which they had just ridden past. Prince Andrei was struck at that moment by the change that came over Prince Bagration�s face. His face expressed that concentrated and happy resolve which occurs in a man who is about to throw himself into the water on a hot day and is making a running start. Neither the sleepy, lackluster eyes nor the falsely profound look was there: his round, firm, hawk�s eyes looked straight ahead with rapture and a certain disdain, apparently not resting on anything, though his movements were as slow and measured as before.

The regimental commander turned to Prince Bagration, entreating him to ride back, because here it was too dangerous. �Please, Your Excellency, for God�s sake!� he repeated, glancing for confirmation at the officer of the suite, who turned away from him. �There, kindly see!� He drew attention to the bullets that constantly shrieked, sang, and whistled around them. He spoke in the same tone of entreaty and reproach in which a carpenter speaks to a gentleman who has picked up an ax: �We�re used to it, but you�ll get blisters on your hands.� He spoke as if he himself could not be killed by these bullets, and his half-closed eyes gave his words a still more persuasive expression. The staff officer joined in the regimental commander�s admonitions; but Prince Bagration did not respond to them and merely ordered the men to stop shooting and line up so as to make room for the two expected battalions. While he was speaking, the rising wind, as with an invisible hand, drew from right to left the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, and the hill opposite, with the French moving over it, opened out before them. All eyes were involuntarily turned to this French column that was moving towards them, winding down the terraces of the slope. The soldiers� shaggy hats were already visible; one could already distinguish the officers from the men; one could see their standard fluttering against its staff.

�Nice marching,� said someone in Bagration�s suite.

The head of the column was already down in the hollow. The confrontation was to take place on this side of the slope�

The remnants of our regiment which had been in action, lining up hastily, moved to the right; from behind them, scattering the stragglers, came the two battalions of the sixth chasseurs in good order. They had not yet reached Bagration, but one could already hear the heavy, weighty tread of a whole mass of men marching in step. On the left flank, closest of all to Bagration, marched a company commander, a round-faced, stately man with a stupid, happy expression on his face, the same one who had come running from the lean-to. He was obviously thinking of nothing at that moment but the fine figure he would cut as he marched past his superior.

With a parade-like self-satisfaction, he marched lightly on his muscular legs, as if floating, holding himself straight without the least effort, and distinguishing himself by this lightness from the heavy tread of the soldiers who marched in step with him. He carried by his leg an unsheathed, thin, and narrow sword (a curved little sword, not resembling a weapon), and he lithely turned his whole strong body, looking now at his superior, now behind him, without losing step. It seemed that all the forces of his soul were aimed at marching past his superior in the best possible way, and, feeling that he was doing it well, he was happy. �Left�left�left�� he seemed to be saying to himself at every other step, and the wall of soldiers� figures, burdened by packs and muskets, with variously stern faces, moved to this rhythm, as if each of those hundreds of soldiers was mentally saying: �Left�left�left�� at every other step. A fat major, puffing and breaking the step, turned around a bush that was in his way; a lagging soldier, breathless, with a frightened face because of his negligence, trotted to catch up with his company; a cannonball, pushing through the air, flew over the heads of Prince Bagration and his suite, and to the rhythm of �Left�left�left!� struck the column. �Close ranks!� came the dashing voice of the company commander. The soldiers curved around something at the spot where the cannonball had landed, and a decorated old soldier, a sergeant on the flank, after lingering by the dead men, caught up with his line, skipped to change feet, fell into step, and looked back angrily. �Left�left�left�� seemed to be heard through the ominous silence and the monotonous sound of feet simultaneously tramping the ground.

�Bravo, lads!� said Prince Bagration.

�Glad to be of�Your Ex-ex-ex-ex-ex!�� rolled through the ranks. A sullen soldier, marching on the left, turned his eyes to Bagration as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: �We know it ourselves� another, without looking and as if fearing to be distracted, opened his mouth wide, shouted, and passed by.

They were ordered to stop and remove their packs.

Bagration rode around the ranks that had gone past him and dismounted. He handed the reins to a Cossack, removed and handed over his felt cloak, stretched his legs, and straightened his peaked cap. The head of the French column, with officers in the fore, appeared from the bottom of the hill.

�God be with us!� Bagration said in a firm, audible voice, turned for a moment to the front line, and, swinging his arms slightly, with the awkward gait of a cavalryman, as if working at it, he went forward over the uneven field. Prince Andrei felt that some invincible force was drawing him forward, and he experienced great happiness.

The French were already close; walking beside Bagration, Prince Andrei could already make out clearly the bandoliers, the red epaulettes, even the faces of the French. (He clearly saw one old French officer walking uphill with difficulty on splayed feet in gaiters, holding on to bushes.) Prince Bagration gave no new order and went on walking silently in front of the ranks. Suddenly from among the French came the crack of a shot, a second, a third�and all across the disordered enemy ranks spread smoke and the crackle of gunfire. Several of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer who had marched so cheerfully and diligently. But just as the first shot rang out, Bagration turned around and shouted, �Hurrah!�

�Hurra-a-ah!� the prolonged cry spread throughout our line, and, outstripping Prince Bagration and each other, in a disorderly but cheerful and lively crowd, our men ran down the hill after the disordered French.


XIX

The attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of the right flank. In the center, the action of Tushin�s forgotten battery, which managed to set fire to Sch&#246;ngraben, stayed the movement of the French. The French were putting out the fire, which was spread by the wind, and allowing time for retreat. The retreat of the center across the ravine was hasty and noisy; however, the troops, in retreating, did not mix up their detachments. But the left flank, which was simultaneously being attacked and encircled by the superior forces of the French under Lannes, and which consisted of the Azovsky and Podolsky infantry regiments and the Pavlogradsky hussar regiment, was in disorder. Bagration sent Zherkov to the general of the left flank with an order to retreat immediately.

Zherkov, not taking his hand from his cap, briskly started his horse and galloped off. But as soon as he left Bagration, his strength failed him. An insurmountable fear came over him, and he was unable to go where there was danger.

Having reached the troops of the left flank, he did not ride forward, where the shooting was, but went looking for the general and the officers where they could not be, and therefore did not deliver the order.

The command of the left flank belonged, in order of superiority, to the commander of the same regiment that had been presented to Kutuzov at Braunau and in which Dolokhov served as a private. But the command of the extreme left flank was given to the commander of the Pavlogradsky regiment, in which Rostov served, owing to which a misunderstanding arose. The two officers were greatly vexed with each other, and at a time when action had long since started on the right flank, and the French had already begun their offensive, the two officers were taken up with an exchange which had the aim of insulting each other. The regiments, cavalry as well as infantry, were very little prepared for the forthcoming action. The men of the regiments, from private to general, were not expecting a battle and were calmly occupied with peaceful matters: feeding horses in the cavalry, gathering firewood in the infantry.

�If he, however, is senior to mine in the ranking,� the German hussar colonel said, turning red and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, �leave him to do as he wants. I my hussars cannot sacrifice. Bugler! Sound the retreat!�

But things were becoming urgent. Cannonades and gunfire, blending, rumbled on the right and in the center, and the French greatcoats of Lannes�s riflemen were already passing the mill dam and forming up on this side, two musket shots away. The infantry general went up to a horse with his bouncing gait, mounted it, becoming very straight and tall, and rode to the Pavlogradsky commander. The regimental commanders came together with polite bows and with concealed spite in their hearts.

�Once again, Colonel,� the general said, �I cannot in any case leave half my men in the woods. I beg you, I beg you,� he repeated, �to take up your position and prepare for the attack.�

�And I beg you not to interfieren in vat is not your business,� the colonel replied hotly. �If you vere a cavalryman��

�I am not a cavalryman, Colonel, but I am a Russian general, and if that is not known to you��

�Very much known, Your Excellency,� the colonel suddenly cried, starting his horse and turning a reddish purple. �Be so kind please to go to the front, and you vill see that this position is good f&#252;r nothing. I do not vant to destroy my regiment f&#252;r your pleasure.�

�You forget yourself, Colonel. I am not concerned with my own pleasure, and I will not allow you to say so.�

The general, accepting the colonel�s invitation to a tournament of courage, drew himself up and, frowning, rode with him in the direction of the front, as if all their differences had to be resolved there, at the front, amidst the bullets. They reached the front, several bullets flew over them, and they stopped in silence. There was nothing to look at there, because even from the place where they had been standing before, it had been clear that cavalry could not operate in the bushes and ravines, and that the French were turning their left wing. The general and the colonel stared sternly and significantly at each other, like two cocks preparing to fight, vainly waiting for signs of cowardice. Both passed the examination. Since there was nothing to say, and neither of them wanted to give the other a pretext for claiming he had been the first to run away from the bullets, they would have stood there for a long time, testing each other�s courage, if at that moment, in the woods, almost behind them, there had not come a crackle of musket fire and a muffled, merging cry. The French had attacked the soldiers who had gone there for firewood. The hussars could no longer retreat together with the infantry. They were cut off from the path of retreat to the left by the French line. Now, however inconvenient the terrain was, it was necessary to attack in order to cut a path for themselves.

The squadron in which Rostov served had just had time to mount its horses when it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as on the Enns bridge, there was no one between the squadron and the enemy, and there lay between them, separating them, that same terrible line of the unknown and of fear, like the line separating the living from the dead. All the men sensed that line, and the question of whether they would or would not cross that line, and how they would cross it, troubled them.

The colonel rode up to the front, angrily gave some answer to the officers� questions, and, like a man desperately insisting on having his own way, gave some order. No one said anything definite, but the rumor of an attack swept through the squadron. The command to form up was heard, then sabers shrieked as they were drawn from their scabbards. But still no one moved. The troops of the left flank, both infantry and hussars, sensed that their superiors themselves did not know what to do, and the indecisiveness of the superiors communicated itself to the troops.

�Hurry up, hurry up,� thought Rostov, sensing that the time had come at last to experience the delight of an attack, of which he had heard so much from his hussar comrades.

�God be with us, lads,� Denisov�s voice rang out. �At a trot, march!�

The croups of the horses in the front row moved. Little Rook pulled at the reins and started off himself.

To the right Rostov saw the first rows of his hussars, and still further ahead he could see a dark strip, which he could not make out but thought to be the enemy. Shots were fired, but in the distance.

�Quicken the trot,� came the command, and Rostov felt his Little Rook kick up his rump, switching to a canter.

He guessed his movements ahead of time, and felt merrier and merrier. He noticed a solitary tree ahead. This tree was first ahead of him, in the middle of the line that seemed so terrible. But then they crossed that line, and not only was there nothing frightening, but everything became merrier and livelier. �Oh, how I�m going to slash at him,� thought Rostov, gripping the hilt of his saber.

�Hur-r-ra-a-ah!� voices droned.

�Well, now let anybody at all come along,� thought Rostov, spurring Little Rook and, outstripping the others, sending him into a full gallop. The enemy could already be seen ahead. Suddenly something lashed at the squadron as if with a broad besom. Rostov raised his sword, preparing to strike, but just then the soldier Nikitenko galloped past, leaving him behind, and Rostov felt, as in a dream, that he was still racing on with unnatural speed and at the same time was staying in place. The familiar hussar Bandarchuk galloped towards him from behind and looked at him angrily. Bandarchuk�s horse shied, and he swerved around him.

�What is it? I�m not moving ahead? I�ve fallen, I�ve been killed�� Rostov asked and answered in the same instant. He was alone now in the middle of the field. Instead of moving horses and hussar backs, he saw the immobile earth and stubble around him. There was warm blood under him. �No, I�m wounded, and my horse has been killed.� Little Rook tried to get up on his forelegs, but fell back, pinning his rider�s leg. Blood flowed from the horse�s head. The horse thrashed and could not get up. Rostov went to get up and also fell: his pouch caught on the saddle. Where ours were, where the French were�he did not know. There was no one around.

Having freed his leg, he got up. �Where, on which side now was that line which had so sharply separated the two armies?� he asked himself, and could not answer. �Has something bad happened to me? There are such cases, and what must be done in such cases?� he asked himself, standing up; and just then he felt that something superfluous was hanging from his numb left arm. His hand was like someone else�s. He examined the hand, vainly looking for blood on it. �Well, here are some people,� he thought joyfully, seeing several men running towards him. �They�ll help me!� In front of these people ran one in a strange shako and a blue greatcoat, dark, tanned, with a hooked nose. Two more and then many came running behind him. One of them said something strange, non-Russian. Among the men in the back, wearing the same shakos, stood a Russian hussar. He was being held by the arms; behind him they were holding his horse.

�He must be one of ours taken prisoner�Yes. Can it be they�ll take me, too? What men are these?� Rostov kept thinking, not believing his eyes. �Can they be Frenchmen?� He looked at the approaching Frenchmen and, though a moment before he had been galloping only in order to meet these Frenchmen and cut them to pieces, their closeness now seemed so terrible to him that he could not believe his eyes. �Who are they? Why are they running? Can it be they�re running to me? Can it be? And why? To kill me? Me, whom everybody loves so?� He remembered his mother�s love for him, his family�s, his friends�, and the enemy�s intention to kill him seemed impossible. �But maybe even�to kill me!� He stood for more than ten seconds without moving from the spot or understanding his situation. The first Frenchman with the hooked nose came so close that the expression on his face could already be seen. And the flushed alien physiognomy of this man who, with lowered bayonet, holding his breath, was running lightly towards him, frightened Rostov. He seized his pistol and, instead of firing it, threw it at the Frenchman, and ran for the bushes as fast as he could. He ran not with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had gone to the Enns bridge, but with the feeling of a hare escaping from hounds. One undivided feeling of fear for his young, happy life possessed his entire being. Quickly leaping over the hedges, with that swiftness with which he had run playing tag, he flew across the field, turning his pale, kind young face back from time to time, and a chill of terror ran down his spine. �No, it�s better not to look,� he thought, but, running up to the bushes, he turned once more. The Frenchmen lagged behind, and even as he looked back, the front one had just changed his trot to a walk and, turning around, shouted something loudly to his comrade behind him. Rostov stopped. �Something must be wrong,� he thought, �it�s impossible that they should want to kill me.� And meanwhile his left arm was as heavy as though a twenty-pound weight was hanging from it. He could not run any further. The Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostov closed his eyes and crouched down. One, two bullets flew whistling past him. He gathered his last strength, held on to his left arm with his right hand, and ran to the bushes. In the bushes there were Russian riflemen.


XX

The infantry regiments, caught unawares in the woods, ran out of the woods, and, companies mixing with other companies, retreated in disordered crowds. One soldier uttered in fear the words: �Cut off!��senseless and terrible in time of war�and the words, together with the fear, communicated themselves to the whole mass.

�We�re surrounded! Cut off! Lost!� cried the voices of running men.

The regimental commander, the moment he heard shooting and cries behind him, knew that something terrible had happened to his regiment, and the thought that he, an exemplary officer, with many years of service, to blame for nothing, might be blamed before his superiors for negligence or inefficiency, struck him so much that, at that same moment, forgetting both the disobedient cavalry colonel and his own dignity as a general, and above all totally forgetting danger and the sense of self-preservation, he gripped the pommel, spurred his horse, and galloped off to his regiment under a hail of bullets that poured down on but luckily missed him. He wanted one thing: to find out what was going on, and help to rectify at all costs any error, if there was one, on his part, so that he, an exemplary officer, with twenty-two years of service, and never reprimanded for anything, would not be blamed for it.

Having galloped luckily through the French, he came to the field beyond the woods through which our men were running and, disobeying commands, heading down the hill. That moment of moral hesitation came which decides the fate of battles: would these disorderly crowds of soldiers heed the voice of their commander, or look at him and go on running? Despite the desperate shouts of the regimental commander, formerly so terrible for the soldiers, despite the furious, crimson face of the regimental commander, who no longer resembled himself, and the waving of his sword, the soldiers went on running, talking, firing into the air, and not listening to his commands. The moral hesitation that decides the fate of battles was obviously being resolved in favor of fear.

The general began to choke from shouting and powder smoke, and stopped in despair. All seemed lost, but at that moment the French, who had been advancing upon our men, suddenly, for no visible reason, ran back, disappeared from the edge of the woods, and in the woods Russian riflemen appeared. This was Timokhin�s company, which alone had kept its order in the woods and, having hidden in a ditch nearby, had unexpectedly attacked the French. Timokhin had fallen upon the French with such a desperate cry and such insane and drunken determination, running at the enemy with nothing but a little sword, that the French, having no time to recover, threw down their arms and fled. Dolokhov, who was running beside Timokhin, killed one Frenchman point-blank and was the first to take a surrendering officer by the collar. The fleeing men returned, the battalions formed up, and the French, who had divided the troops of the left flank in two, were momentarily pressed back. The reserve units had time to join in, and the fleeing soldiers stopped. The regimental commander was standing by the bridge with Major Ekonomov, letting the retreating companies pass by him, when a soldier came up to him, took hold of his stirrup, and almost leaned against him. The soldier was wearing a greatcoat of bluish factory broadcloth, he had no pack or shako, his head was bandaged, and there was a French ammunition pouch slung over his shoulder. In his hand he was holding an officer�s sword. The soldier was pale, his blue eyes looked insolently into the regimental commander�s face, and his mouth smiled. Though the regimental commander was busy giving orders to Major Ekonomov, he could not help paying attention to this soldier.

�Your Excellency, here are two trophies,� said Dolokhov, pointing to the French sword and pouch. �I captured an officer. I stopped the company.� Dolokhov was breathing heavily from fatigue; he spoke with pauses. �The whole company can testify. I ask you to remember, Your Excellency!�

�Very well, very well,� said the regimental commander, and he turned to Major Ekonomov.

But Dolokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief, pulled it off, and showed the clotted blood on his head.

�A bayonet wound. I stayed at the front. Remember, Your Excellency.�

Tushin�s battery was forgotten, and only at the very end of the action did Prince Bagration, still hearing cannon fire from the center, send the staff officer on duty there and then Prince Andrei, to order the battery to retreat as quickly as possible. The covering troops stationed next to Tushin�s cannon had left on somebody�s order in the middle of the action; but the battery went on firing and was not taken by the French only because the enemy could not suppose that such bold firing was coming from four unprotected cannon. On the contrary, from the energetic operation of the battery, they supposed that the main Russian forces were concentrated there in the center, and they tried twice to attack that point, and were driven off both times by the canister fire of the four cannon standing solitarily on the elevation.

Soon after Prince Bagration�s departure, Tushin managed to set fire to Sch&#246;ngraben.

�Look, they�re scurrying around! It�s burning! Look at the smoke! Fine work! Grand! What smoke, what smoke!� said the crews, growing animated.

Without any order, all the cannon were turned in the direction of the fire. As if egging it on, the soldiers kept crying at each shot: �Fine work! That�s the way! Just look�Grand!� The fire, borne by the wind, spread quickly. The French columns that had moved out of the village went back, but, as if in punishment for this failure, the enemy set up ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at Tushin.

Owing to the childlike joy aroused by the fire, and the excitement of their successful shooting at the French, our artillerists noticed this battery only when two cannonballs and then four more landed among the guns, and one brought down two horses and another tore the leg off a caisson master. The animation, once established, did not weaken, however, but only changed in mood. The horses were replaced by others from spare carriages, the wounded were removed, and the four guns were turned against the ten-cannon battery. An officer, Tushin�s comrade, had been killed at the beginning of the action, and in the course of an hour seventeen out of the forty men of the gun crews had been eliminated, yet the artillerists were still just as merry and animated. Twice they noticed that the French had appeared below, close to them, and then they fired on them with canister shot.

The small man with weak, awkward movements constantly asked his orderly to give him another little pipeful for that, as he put it, and spilling fire from it, ran forward and looked at the French from under his small hand.

�Smash �em, lads!� he kept saying and would seize the guns by the wheel and unscrew the screws himself.

Amidst the smoke, deafened by the ceaseless firing, which made him jump each time, Tushin, without relinquishing his nose-warmer, ran from one gun to the other, now taking aim, now counting the charges, now ordering the dead and wounded horses to be changed and reharnessed, and shouting all the while in his weak, high, irresolute voice. His face was growing more and more animated. Only when people were killed or wounded, he winced and, turning away from the dead man, shouted angrily at his crew, who, as always, were slow to pick up a wounded man or a body. His soldiers, for the most part fine, handsome fellows (two heads taller and twice as broad as their officer, as always in a battery company), all looked to their commander, like children in a difficult situation, and the expression on his face was inevitably mirrored on theirs.

As a result of the dreadful rumbling, the noise, the necessity for attention and activity, Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant feeling of fear, and the thought that he could be killed or painfully wounded did not occur to him. On the contrary, he felt ever merrier and merrier. It seemed to him that the moment when he saw the enemy and fired the first shot was already very long ago, maybe even yesterday, and that the spot on the field where he stood was a long-familiar and dear place to him. Though he remembered everything, considered everything, did everything the best officer could do in his position, he was in a state similar to feverish delirium or to that of a drunken man.

From the deafening noise of his guns on all sides, from the whistling and thud of the enemy�s shells, from the sight of the sweaty, flushed crews hustling about the guns, from the sight of the blood of men and horses, from the sight of the little puffs of smoke on the enemy�s side (after each of which a cannonball came flying and hit the ground, a man, a cannon, or a horse)�owing to the sight of all these things, there was established in his head a fantastic world of his own, which made up his pleasure at that moment. In his imagination, the enemy�s cannon were not cannon but pipes, from which an invisible smoker released an occasional puff of smoke.

�Look, he�s puffing away again,� Tushin said to himself in a whisper, as a puff of smoke leaped from the hillside and was borne leftwards in a strip by the wind, �now wait for the ball�and send it back.�

�What orders, Your Honor?� asked the fireworker, who was standing close to him and heard him mutter something.

�Nothing�a shell�� he replied.

�Now for our Matvevna,� he said to himself. In his imagination, Matvevna was the big cannon at the end, of ancient casting. The French looked like ants around their guns. A handsome man and a drunkard, the number one at the second gun was known in his world as uncle; Tushin looked at him more often than at the others and rejoiced at his every movement. The sound of musket fire at the foot of the hill, now dying down, now intensifying again, seemed to him like someone�s breathing. He listened to the fading and flaring up of these sounds.

�Hah, breathing again, breathing,� he said to himself.

He pictured himself as of enormous size, a mighty man, flinging cannonballs at the French with both hands.

�Well, Matvevna, old girl, don�t let us down!� he said, moving away from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice rang out over his head.

�Captain Tushin! Captain!�

Tushin turned around, frightened. It was the same staff officer who had driven him out of Grunt. He was shouting at him in a breathless voice:

�What, have you lost your mind? You�ve been ordered twice to retreat, but you��

�Well, what are they getting at me for?�� Tushin thought to himself, looking fearfully at his superior.

�I�nothing�� he said, putting two fingers to his visor. �I��

But the colonel did not finish everything he wanted to say. A cannonball flew close to him and made him duck and crouch down on his horse. He fell silent and was about to say something more when another cannonball stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped away.

�Retreat! Everybody retreat!� he called from the distance.

The soldiers laughed. A moment later an adjutant arrived with the same order.

This was Prince Andrei. The first thing he saw on riding out into the space occupied by Tushin�s cannon was an unharnessed horse with a shattered leg that was whinnying near the harnessed horses. Blood was pouring from its leg as from a spout. Among the limbers several men lay dead. One cannonball after another flew over him as he rode on, and he felt a nervous shiver run down his spine. But the thought alone that he was afraid picked him up again. �I can�t be afraid,� he thought and slowly dismounted among the cannon. He delivered the order and did not leave the battlefield. He decided that the guns would leave the position and be taken away in his presence. Together with Tushin, stepping over the bodies and under the dreadful fire of the French, he got busy with removing the guns.

�Another superior just came, and he turned tail quickly,� the fireworker said to Prince Andrei, �not like Your Honor.�

Prince Andrei said nothing to Tushin. The two men were so busy that they seemed not even to see each other. Having limbered up the two remaining guns of the four (one smashed cannon and a unicorn were abandoned), Prince Andrei rode up to Tushin.

�Well, good-bye,� said Prince Andrei, offering his hand to Tushin.

�Good-bye, dear heart,� said Tushin, �you good soul! Good-bye, dear heart,� Tushin said with tears, which for some reason suddenly came to his eyes.


XXI

The wind grew still, black clouds hung low over the place of battle, merging on the horizon with powder smoke. It was getting dark, and the glow of the fire showed more clearly in two places. The cannonade became weaker, but the crackle of gunfire behind and to the right was heard more often and close. As soon as Tushin with his guns, driving around or over the wounded, came out from under fire and descended into the ravine, he met the superiors and adjutants, among whom were the staff officer and Zherkov, who had been sent twice and had twice failed to reach Tushin�s battery. All of them, interrupting each other, gave and conveyed orders of how and where to go, and reproached and reprimanded him. Tushin had no orders to give and rode silently behind them on his artillery nag, fearing to speak, because he was ready at every word to burst into tears, not knowing why himself. Though the order was to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged after the troops, asking to be put on the guns. The dashing infantry officer who had run out of Tushin�s lean-to before the battle was put on Matvevna�s carriage, a bullet in his stomach. At the foot of the hill a pale hussar junker, holding one arm with his other hand, came up to Tushin and asked for a seat.

�Captain, for God�s sake, I�ve bruised my arm,� he said timidly. �For God�s sake, I can�t walk. For God�s sake!�

It was clear that this junker had already asked for a seat more than once elsewhere and everywhere had been refused. He asked in an irresolute and pitiful voice.

�Tell them to give me a seat, for God�s sake.�

�Give him a seat, give him a seat,� said Tushin. �You, uncle, spread a greatcoat under him,� he turned to his favorite soldier. �And where�s the wounded officer?�

�We unloaded him, he died,� someone answered.

�Give this one a seat. Sit down, my dear, sit down. Spread the greatcoat under him, Antonov.�

The junker was Rostov. He was holding one arm with the other hand, was pale, and his lower jaw was trembling feverishly. He was seated on Matvevna, the same cannon from which they had unloaded the dead officer. The greatcoat spread under him had blood on it, which stained Rostov�s breeches and hands.

�What, are you wounded, dear heart?� asked Tushin, coming to the cannon on which Rostov was sitting.

�No, bruised.�

�Why is there blood on the side plate?� asked Tushin.

�That officer bloodied it, Your Honor,� the artillerist replied, wiping the blood with the sleeve of his greatcoat and as if apologizing for the unclean state the gun was in.

They were barely able, with the help of the infantry, to get the guns up the hill, and having reached the village of Guntersdorf, they halted. It grew so dark that it was impossible to make out the soldiers� uniforms from ten paces away, and the crossfire began to die down. Suddenly, close by on the right-hand side, shouts and gunfire were heard again. Shots flashed in the darkness. This was the last attack of the French, which was being fought off by soldiers sheltering in the village houses. All rushed out of the village again, but Tushin�s guns could not move, and the artillerists, Tushin, and the junker silently looked at each other, awaiting their fate. The crossfire began to die down, and soldiers, talking animatedly, poured out of a side street.

�Unhurt, Petrov?� asked one.

�We roasted �em, brother. They won�t try that again,� said another.

�Couldn�t see a thing. What a roasting they gave their own! Couldn�t see, it�s so dark, brother. Got anything to drink?�

The French had been beaten off for the last time. And again, in total darkness, Tushin�s guns, as if framed by the humming infantry, moved on somewhere.

It was as if an invisible, gloomy river were flowing in the darkness, all in one direction, with a hum of whispers, talk, and the sounds of hooves and wheels. In the general hum, the groans and voices of the wounded sounded most clearly of all in the gloom of the night. Their groans seemed to fill all the gloom surrounding the troops. Their groans and the gloom of that night were one and the same. After some time there was a stir in the moving crowd. Someone with a suite rode by on a white horse and said something as he rode by.

�What did he say? Where to now? A halt, or what? Did he thank us, or what?� eager questions came from all sides, and the entire moving mass began to push upon itself (evidently those in front had stopped), and a rumor spread that there was an order to halt. They all halted where they were, in the middle of the muddy road.

Fires were lit and the talk became more audible. Captain Tushin, having given orders to his company, sent one of the soldiers to look for a dressing station or a doctor for the junker and sat down by the fire the soldiers had started on the road. Rostov also dragged himself to the fire. A feverish trembling from pain, cold, and dampness shook his whole body. Sleep was coming over him irresistibly, yet he could not fall asleep from the tormenting pain in his arm, which ached and found no comfortable position. Now he closed his eyes, then he gazed at the fire, which seemed a hot red to him, then at the stooping, weak little figure of Tushin, who was sitting next to him Turkish fashion. Tushin�s large, kind, and intelligent eyes were directed at him with compassion and commiseration. He saw that Tushin wanted with all his heart to help him in some way and could not.

On all sides one could hear the footsteps and talk of the infantry walking, driving, and settling themselves around. The sounds of voices, footsteps, and horses� hooves treading in the mud, the crackling of firewood far and near merged into one rippling hum.

Now it was not, as before, an invisible river flowing in the darkness, but like a gloomy sea subsiding and quivering after a storm. Rostov mindlessly watched and listened to what was happening before him and around him. An infantryman came up to the fire, squatted down, put his hands to the fire, and turned his face away.

�You don�t mind, Your Honor?� he said, turning questioningly to Tushin. �I�ve strayed from my company, Your Honor; I don�t know where myself. Worse luck!�

Along with the soldier, an infantry officer with a bound cheek came up to the campfire and addressed Tushin, asking him to move the guns a little bit to let his wagon pass. After the company commander, two soldiers ran to the campfire. They fought and cursed terribly, pulling some boot from each other.

�Sure you picked it up! What a quick-fingers!� one cried in a hoarse voice.

Then came a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloody footcloth, and in an angry voice demanded water from the artillerists.

�What, is a man to die like a dog?� he said.

Tushin ordered them to give him water. Then a merry soldier ran up, asking for a little fire for the infantry.

�Some hot little fire for the infantry! Keep well, dear countrymen, thanks for the fire, we�ll pay it back with interest,� he said, carrying the burning brand somewhere into the darkness.

After this soldier, four soldiers carrying something heavy on a greatcoat passed by the campfire. One of them tripped.

�The devils left firewood on the road,� he growled.

�He�s dead, why carry him around?� asked one of them.

�Eh, you!�

And they disappeared into the darkness with their burden.

�What? it hurts?� Tushin asked Rostov in a whisper.

�Yes.�

�The general wants you, Your Honor. He�s staying in a cottage here,� said the fireworker, coming up to Tushin.

�At once, dear heart.�

Tushin got up and, buttoning his greatcoat and smoothing himself out, left the campfire�

Not far from the artillerists� campfire, in a cottage prepared for him, Prince Bagration was sitting over dinner, talking with some commanders of branches who had gathered with him. There was the little old man with half-closed eyes, greedily gnawing on a lamb bone, and the twenty-two-year irreproachable general, flushed from a glass of vodka and dinner, and the staff officer with the signet ring, and Zherkov, looking around uneasily at them all, and Prince Andrei, pale, with compressed lips and feverishly shining eyes.

In the corner of the cottage stood a captured French standard, and the auditor with the na&#239;ve face fingered the fabric of the standard and shook his head in perplexity, perhaps because he was indeed interested in the look of the standard, or perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look at the table where there was no place set for him. In the cottage next door was a French colonel, taken prisoner by the dragoons. Our officers clustered around him, studying him. Prince Bagration thanked particular superiors and asked for details about the action and the losses. The regimental commander who had been reviewed at Braunau reported to the prince that, as soon as the action began, he withdrew from the woods, gathered the woodcutters and, letting them pass by him, started a bayonet attack with two battalions and overwhelmed the French.

�As soon as I saw that the first battalion was in disorder, Your Excellency, I stood there on the road and thought: �I�ll let them pass and then meet them with ranged fire,� and that�s what I did.�

The regimental commander had so wanted to do that, he had been so sorry that he had had no time to do it, that it seemed to him that all this was exactly so. And perhaps it really was so? As if one could make out in that confusion what was and was not so?

�With that I must observe, Your Excellency,� he went on, remembering Dolokhov�s conversation with Kutuzov and his own last encounter with the demoted soldier, �that the demoted private Dolokhov, before my eyes, took a French officer prisoner and particularly distinguished himself.�

�And I also saw the attack of the Pavlogradsky hussars, Your Excellency,� interrupted Zherkov, looking around uneasily, though he had not seen any hussars that day, but had only heard about them from an infantry officer. �They broke two squares, Your Excellency.�

Some smiled at Zherkov�s words, expecting a joke from him as usual; but, noticing that what he said also contributed to the glory of our arms and of that day, they assumed serious expressions, though many knew very well that what Zherkov had said was a lie, with no foundation at all. Prince Bagration turned to the little old colonel.

�I thank you all, gentlemen, all the branches acted heroically: infantry, cavalry, and artillery. How is it that two guns in the center were abandoned?� he asked, seeking someone with his eyes. (Prince Bagration did not ask about the guns of the left flank; he already knew that all the cannon there had been abandoned at the very beginning.) �I asked you to go, I believe,� he turned to the staff officer on duty.

�One was knocked out,� the staff officer replied, �but I cannot understand about the other. I was there myself all the while and giving orders, and I had only just left�It was hot, to tell the truth,� he added modestly.

Someone said that Captain Tushin was there near the village and had already been sent for.

�You were there, too,� said Prince Bagration, turning to Prince Andrei.

�Of course, we nearly ran into each other,� said the staff officer on duty, smiling pleasantly at Bolkonsky.

�I did not have the pleasure of seeing you,� Prince Andrei said coldly and abruptly. They all fell silent.

Tushin appeared in the doorway, timidly making his way from behind the generals� backs. Going around the generals in the crowded cottage, embarrassed as usual at the sight of his superiors, Tushin did not see the staff of the standard and stumbled over it. Several voices laughed.

�How is it that a gun was abandoned?� asked Bagration, frowning not so much at the captain as at those who laughed, among whom Zherkov�s voice sounded louder than the others.

Only now, at the sight of his dread superiors, did Tushin realize in all its horror his guilt and disgrace at having remained alive while losing two guns. He had been so agitated that until that moment he had not managed to think of it. The laughter of the officers threw him off still more. He stood before Bagration with a trembling lower jaw and was barely able to say:

�I don�t know�Your Excellency�I had no men, Your Excellency.�

�You could have taken some of the covering troops!�

Tushin did not tell him that there were no covering troops, though that was the plain truth. He was afraid to let down another officer that way and silently, with fixed eyes, looked straight into Bagration�s face, as a confused student looks into his examiner�s eyes.

The silence was rather prolonged. Prince Bagration, probably unwilling to be severe, could not find what to say; the rest did not dare mix into the conversation. Prince Andrei looked at Tushin from under his eyebrows, and his fingers twitched nervously.

�Your Excellency,� Prince Andrei broke the silence with his sharp voice, �you were pleased to send me to Captain Tushin�s battery. I was there and found two-thirds of the men and horses killed, two guns crippled, and no cover at all.�

Prince Bagration and Tushin now looked with the same intentness at Bolkonsky, who was speaking with restraint and agitation.

�And if Your Excellency will allow me to voice my opinion,� he went on, �we owe the success of the day most of all to the operation of this battery and the heroic endurance of Captain Tushin and his company,� said Prince Andrei and, without waiting for a reply, he got up at once and stepped away from the table.

Prince Bagration looked at Tushin and, obviously not wishing to show any mistrust of Bolkonsky�s sharp judgment, and at the same time feeling himself unable to believe him fully, inclined his head and told Tushin he could go. Prince Andrei went out after him.

�Thank you, dear heart, you rescued me,� Tushin said to him.

Prince Andrei looked at Tushin and, saying nothing, walked away. Prince Andrei felt sad and downhearted. All this was so strange, so unlike what he had hoped for.





�Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will it all end?� thought Rostov, looking at the shifting shadows before him. The pain in his arm was becoming more and more tormenting. Sleep drew him irresistibly, red circles danced before his eyes, and the impressions of those voices and those faces and a feeling of loneliness merged with the feeling of pain. It was they, these soldiers, wounded and not wounded�it was they who crushed and weighed down and twisted the sinews and burned the flesh of his racked arm and shoulder. To get rid of them, he closed his eyes.

He became oblivious for a moment, but in that brief interval of oblivion he saw a numberless multitude of things in a dream: he saw his mother and her large white hand, saw Sonya�s thin little shoulders, Natasha�s eyes and laughter, and Denisov with his voice and mustache, and Telyanin, and his whole story with Telyanin and Bogdanych. That whole story was the same as this soldier with the sharp voice, and that whole story and this soldier were what held, crushed, and pulled his arm to one side so painfully and relentlessly. He tried to get away from them, but they would not let go of his shoulder for a moment, for a split second. It would not hurt, it would be well, if they were not pulling on it; but there was no getting rid of them.

He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of the night hung three feet above the light from the coals. A dust of falling snow flew through that light. Tushin did not return, the doctor did not come. He was alone, only some little soldier now sat naked on the other side of the fire, warming his thin, yellow body.

�Nobody needs me!� thought Rostov. �There�s nobody to help me or pity me. And once I was at home, strong, cheerful, loved.� He sighed and involuntarily groaned as he sighed.

�Ouch, it hurts, eh?� the little soldier asked, waving his shirt over the fire and, not waiting for a reply, he grunted and said: �Quite a few folk got damaged today�awful!�

Rostov was not listening to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes dancing above the fire and remembered the Russian winter with a warm, bright house, a fluffy fur coat, swift sleighs, a healthy body, and all the love and care of a family. �And why did I come here?� he wondered.

The next day the French did not renew the attack, and the remnant of Bagration�s detachment joined Kutuzov�s army.



��������� Part Three ���������


I

Prince Vassily did not think out his plans. Still less did he think of doing people harm in order to profit from it. He was simply a man of the world, who succeeded in the world and made a habit of that success. According to his circumstances and his intimacy with people, he constantly formed various plans and schemes which he himself was not quite aware of, but which constituted all the interest of his life. He would have not one or two of these plans and schemes going, but dozens, of which some were only beginning to take shape for him, while others were coming to completion, and still others were abolished. He did not say to himself, for instance: �Here is a man who is now in power, I must gain his trust and friendship and through him arrange for myself the payment of a one-time subsidy,� nor did he say to himself: �Here Pierre is rich, I must entice him to marry my daughter and borrow the forty thousand that I need from him� but let him meet a man in power, and in the same moment his instinct would tell him that the man might be useful, and Prince Vassily would become intimate with him and at the first opportunity, without any preparation, instinctively, would flatter him, behave familiarly, talk about what was needed.

He had Pierre at hand in Moscow, and Prince Vassily arranged for him an appointment as gentleman of the bedchamber, which was then equal to the rank of state councillor, and insisted that the young man should go with him to Petersburg and stay in his house. As if absentmindedly and at the same time with an indubitable assurance that it had to be so, Prince Vassily did everything necessary to have Pierre marry his daughter. If Prince Vassily had thought out his plans beforehand, he would not have had such naturalness in his dealings and such simplicity and familiarity in his relations with all people, whether of higher or lower station than himself. Something constantly drew him to people more powerful or richer than he, and he was endowed with the rare art of seizing the precise moment when he should and could make use of people.

Pierre, on unexpectedly becoming a rich man and Count Bezukhov, felt himself, after his recent solitary and carefree life, so surrounded, so taken up, that it was only in bed that he managed to remain alone with himself. He had to sign papers, communicate with government offices of whose significance he had no clear notion, ask his chief steward about something, go to his estate near Moscow, and receive a host of persons who formerly did not even care to know of his existence, but who now would be hurt and chagrined if he did not wish to see them. All these various persons�business connections, relations, acquaintances�were equally well and benignly disposed towards the young heir; they were all obviously and indubitably convinced of Pierre�s high merits. He so constantly heard the words: �With your extraordinary kindness,� or �With your excellent heart,� or �You yourself, Count, are so pure�,� or �If he were as intelligent as you are,� and so on, that he was sincerely beginning to believe in his extraordinary kindness and his extraordinary intelligence, the more so because, deep in his heart, it had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and very intelligent. Even people who had formerly been wicked and obviously hostile became affectionate and loving with him. The angry older princess with the long waist and hair slicked down like a doll�s, came to Pierre�s room after the funeral. Lowering her eyes and blushing constantly, she told him that she was very sorry about the past misunderstandings between them and that she now felt she had no right to ask for anything, except permission, after the blow she had suffered, to stay on for a few weeks in the house in which she had loved so much and sacrificed so much. She could not help herself and wept at these words. Touched to see that this statue-like princess could change so much, Pierre took her by the hand and apologized, not knowing for what himself. Since that day, the princess had begun to knit a striped scarf for Pierre and was totally changed towards him.

�Do it for her, mon cher; after all, she suffered much from the deceased,� Prince Vassily said to him, handing him some paper to sign for the princess�s benefit.

Prince Vassily had decided that they had to throw this bone, a promissory note for thirty thousand, to the poor princess, so that she would not take it into her head to talk about Prince Vassily�s part in the affair of the inlaid portfolio. Pierre had signed the promissory note, and since then the princess had become still kinder. The younger sisters also became affectionate with him, especially the youngest, the pretty one with the little mole, who often confused Pierre with her smiles and her own confusion on seeing him.

It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should love him, it would have seemed so unnatural if someone did not love him, that he could not help believing in the sincerity of the people around him. Besides, he had no time to ask himself about the sincerity or insincerity of these people. He was constantly busy, he constantly felt himself in a state of mild and merry intoxication. He felt himself the center of some important general movement; felt that something was constantly expected of him; that if he were to fail to do this or that, he would upset many people and deprive them of what they expected, but if he were to do this or that, all would be well�and he did what was demanded of him, but this �well� always remained ahead of him.

More than anyone else during this first time, it was Prince Vassily who took possession both of Pierre�s affairs and of Pierre himself. Since the death of Count Bezukhov, he never let Pierre out of his hands. Prince Vassily had the look of a man burdened by affairs, weary, exhausted, but finally unable, out of compassion, to leave to the mercies of fate and of swindlers this helpless youth, his friend�s son, apr&#232;s tout, and with such an immense fortune. In those few days he spent in Moscow after Count Bezukhov�s death, he summoned Pierre to him or went to him himself and prescribed for him what was to be done, in such a tone of weariness and assurance as if he were adding each time:

�Vous savez, que je suis accabl&#233; d�affaires et que ce n�est pas que par pure charit&#233;, que je m�occupe de vous, et puis vous savez bien que ce que je vous propose est la seule chose faisable.�

�Well, my friend, tomorrow we�re off at last,� he said to him one day, closing his eyes, fingering Pierre�s elbow, and in such a tone as if what he said had been decided between them long, long ago and could not have been decided otherwise.

�Tomorrow we�re off, I�m giving you a place in my carriage. I�m very glad. We�ve finished everything that matters here. I should have left long ago. I have received this from the chancellor. I solicited him on your behalf, and you�ve been enrolled in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamber. Now the diplomatic path is open to you.�

Despite all the force of the weary and assured tone in which these words were uttered, Pierre, who had been thinking for so long about his career, was about to object. But Prince Vassily interrupted him in that cooing, bass-voiced tone which precluded the possibility of interrupting his speech and which he made use of in cases requiring extreme persuasiveness.

�Mais, mon cher, I did it for myself, for my conscience, and there�s nothing to thank me for. No one ever complained about being loved too much; and besides, you�re free, you can drop it tomorrow. You�ll see everything for yourself in Petersburg. And it�s long since time that you distanced yourself from these terrible memories.� Prince Vassily sighed. �Yes, yes, dear heart. And let my valet ride in your carriage. Ah, I nearly forgot,� Prince Vassily added, �you know, mon cher, I had some accounts with the deceased, so I�ll keep what I received from Ryazan: you don�t need it. We�ll work it out later.�

What Prince Vassily referred to as �received from Ryazan� was several thousand in quitrent, which Prince Vassily kept for himself.

In Petersburg, just as in Moscow, an atmosphere of affectionate, loving people surrounded Pierre. He could not refuse the post or, rather, the rank (because he did nothing) that Prince Vassily had provided him with, and the acquaintances, invitations, social occupations were so many that Pierre experienced, even more than in Moscow, a feeling of fogginess, hurriedness, and some ever approaching but never attained good.

Of his former bachelor company, many were not in Petersburg. The guards had left on campaign, Dolokhov had been demoted, Anatole was in the army in the provinces, Prince Andrei was abroad, and therefore Pierre had no chance either to spend the nights as he had liked to spend them before, or to ease his heart in a friendly conversation with an older, respected friend. All his time was spent on dinners, balls, and mostly at Prince Vassily�s�in the company of the old, fat princess, his wife, and the beautiful H&#233;l&#232;ne.

Anna Pavlovna Scherer, like the others, manifested to Pierre the change that had occurred in society�s view of him.

Formerly, in Anna Pavlovna�s presence, Pierre had constantly felt that what he said was improper, tactless, out of place; that his remarks, which seemed clever to him while he was preparing them in his imagination, became stupid as soon as he spoke them aloud, and that, on the contrary, the dullest remarks of Ippolit came out as clever and pleasing. Now everything he said came out as charmant. Even if Anna Pavlovna did not say it, he could see that she wanted to say it and only restrained herself out of respect for his modesty.

In the beginning of the winter of 1805�1806, Pierre received the customary pink note from Anna Pavlovna with an invitation, to which was added: �Vous trouverez chez moi la belle H&#233;l&#232;ne, qu�on ne se lasse jamais voir.�

Reading this passage, Pierre felt for the first time that between him and H&#233;l&#232;ne some sort of connection had been formed, recognized by other people, and this thought at the same time frightened him, as if an obligation had been laid upon him which he could not fulfill, and also pleased him as an amusing supposition.

The soir&#233;e at Anna Pavlovna�s was the same as the first, only the novelty that Anna Pavlovna was now treating her guests to was not Mortemart, but a diplomat who had come from Berlin and brought the freshest details about the emperor Alexander�s visit to Potsdam and the two august friends swearing an indissoluble union in defending the right cause against the enemy of the human race. Pierre was received by Anna Pavlovna with a tinge of sorrow which obviously referred to the fresh loss that had befallen the young man, the death of Count Bezukhov (everyone constantly considered it their duty to convince Pierre that he was very grieved by the death of a father he had hardly known)�and the sorrow was of the same sort as that supreme sorrow which was expressed at the mention of the august empress Maria Feodorovna. Pierre felt flattered by it. Anna Pavlovna arranged the circles in her drawing room with her usual artfulness. The large circle where Prince Vassily and the generals were had use of the diplomat. Another circle was formed by the tea table. Pierre wanted to join the first, but Anna Pavlovna, who was in the excited state of a commander on the battlefield, when thousands of brilliant new thoughts come along which one scarcely has time to bring to fulfullment�Anna Pavlovna, seeing Pierre, touched his sleeve with her finger:

�Attendez, j�ai des vues sur vous pour ce soir.� She glanced at H&#233;l&#232;ne and smiled at her.

�Ma bonne H&#233;l&#232;ne, il faut que vous soyez charitable pour ma pauvre tante, qui a une adoration pour vous. Allez lui tenir companie pour dix minutes. And so that it won�t be too boring for you, here you have the dear count, who will not refuse to follow you.�

The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pavlovna kept Pierre by her, making it look as though she had to give some last necessary instructions.

�She�s ravishing, isn�t she?� she said to Pierre, pointing to the majestic beauty as she sailed off. �Et quelle tenue! What tact for such a young girl, and what a masterly ability to behave! It comes from the heart. Happy the one to whom she will belong! With her even the most unworldly husband will involuntarily and effortlessly occupy a brilliant place in society. Isn�t that so? I only wanted to know your opinion.� And Anna Pavlovna let Pierre go.

Pierre was sincere in answering affirmatively Anna Pavlovna�s question about the artfulness of H&#233;l&#232;ne�s behavior. If he ever thought about H&#233;l&#232;ne, he thought precisely about her beauty and that extraordinary, calm ability of hers to be silently dignified in society.

The aunt received the two young people in her corner, but, it seemed, wished to hide her adoration of H&#233;l&#232;ne and rather wished to show her fear before Anna Pavlovna. She glanced at her niece as if asking what she was to do with these people. As she was leaving them, Anna Pavlovna again touched Pierre�s sleeve with her finger and said:

�J�esp&#232;re, que vous ne direz plus qu�on s�ennui chez moi� �and she glanced at H&#233;l&#232;ne.

H&#233;l&#232;ne smiled with an air that said she did not allow the possibility that anyone could see her and not feel admiration. The aunt cleared her throat, swallowed her saliva, and said in French that she was very glad to see H&#233;l&#232;ne; then she turned to Pierre with the same greeting and the same mien. In the middle of the boring and faltering conversation, H&#233;l&#232;ne glanced at Pierre and smiled at him that serene, beautiful smile which she smiled at everyone. Pierre was so used to that smile, it said so little to him, that he did not pay any attention to it. The aunt was talking just then about a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierre�s late father, Count Bezukhov, and she showed her own snuffbox. Princess H&#233;l&#232;ne asked to see the portrait of the aunt�s husband, which was painted on this snuffbox.

�It must be the work of Vinesse,� said Pierre, naming a famous miniaturist, leaning towards the table in order to take the snuffbox in his hands, and listening to the conversation at the other table.

He got up, wishing to go around, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox right over H&#233;l&#232;ne, behind her back. H&#233;l&#232;ne leaned forward so as to make room and, smiling, glanced around. As always at soir&#233;es, she was wearing a gown in the fashion of the time, quite open in front and back. Her bust, which had always looked like marble to Pierre, was now such a short distance from him that he could involuntarily make out with his nearsighted eyes the living loveliness of her shoulders and neck, and so close to his lips that he had only to lean forward a little to touch her. He sensed the warmth of her body, the smell of her perfume, and the creaking of her corset as she breathed. He saw not her marble beauty, which made one with her gown, he saw and sensed all the loveliness of her body, which was merely covered by clothes. And once he had seen it, he could not see otherwise, as we cannot return to a once-exposed deception.

She turned, looked straight at him with her shining dark eyes, and smiled.

�So you never noticed before how beautiful I am?� H&#233;l&#232;ne seemed to say. �You never noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who could belong to anyone, even you,� said her gaze. And at that moment Pierre felt that H&#233;l&#232;ne not only could, but must be his wife, that it could not be otherwise.

He knew it at that moment as certainly as he would have known it standing at the altar with her. How it would be and when, he did not know; he did not even know whether it would be good (he even felt that it was not good for some reason), but he knew that it would be.

Pierre lowered his eyes, raised them again, and wanted to see her once more as a distant, alien beauty, the way he had seen her every day before then; but he could no longer do that. Could not, just as a man who once looked at a stalk of tall grass in the mist and saw it as a tree, can look at the stalk of grass itself and once more see it as a tree. She was terribly close to him. She already had power over him. And there were no longer any obstructions between them, except for the obstruction of his own will.

�Bon, je vous laisse dans votre petit coin. Je vois que vous y &#234;tes tr&#232;s bien,� said the voice of Anna Pavlovna.

And Pierre, trying fearfully to recall whether he had done anything reprehensible, blushed and looked around him. It seemed to him that everyone knew what had happened to him as well as he did.

A short time later, when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pavlovna said to him:

�On dit que vous embellisez votre maison de P&#233;tersbourg.�

(That was true: the architect had said it was needed, and Pierre, not knowing why himself, was redecorating his enormous house in Petersburg.)

�C�est bien, mais ne d&#233;m&#233;nagez pas de chez le prince Basile. Il est bon d�avoir un ami comme le prince,� she said, smiling at Prince Vassily. �J�en sais quelque chose. N�est-ce pas? And you�re still so young. You need advice. You�re not angry with me for exercising an old woman�s rights?� She paused, as women always pause and wait for something after referring to their age. �If you get married, that�s another matter.� And she united them in a single glance. Pierre did not look at H&#233;l&#232;ne, nor she at him. But she was still just as terribly close to him. He mumbled something and blushed.

On returning home, Pierre could not fall asleep for a long time, thinking about what had happened to him. And what had happened to him? Nothing. He had simply realized that a woman he had known as a child, of whom he used to say distractedly, �Yes, good-looking,� when told that H&#233;l&#232;ne was a beauty�he had realized that this woman could belong to him.

�But she�s stupid, I�ve said myself that she�s stupid,� he thought. �This isn�t love. On the contrary, there�s something vile in the feeling she aroused in me, something forbidden. I�ve been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her and she with him, and there was a whole story, and that�s why Anatole was sent away. Ippolit is her brother. Prince Vassily is her father. It�s not good,� he thought; but while he was arguing like that (these arguments were left unfinished), he caught himself smiling and was aware that a whole series of arguments had floated up from behind the others, that he was at the same time thinking about her worthlessness and dreaming of how she would be his wife, how she might come to love him, how she might be quite different, and how everything he had thought and heard about her might be untrue. And again he saw her not as some daughter of Prince Vassily, but saw her whole body, merely covered by a gray dress. �But no, why did this thought not occur to me before?� And again he said to himself that it was impossible, that there would be something vile, unnatural, as it seemed to him, and dishonest in this marriage. He recalled her former words and looks, and the words and looks of those who had seen them together. He recalled the words and looks of Anna Pavlovna when she spoke to him about his house, recalled hundreds of similar hints from Prince Vassily and others, and terror came over him at the thought that he might already have bound himself in some way to go through with something which was obviously not good and which he ought not to do. But while he expressed this realization to himself, on the other side of his soul her image floated up in all its feminine beauty.


II

In November of 1805 Prince Vassily was to go to inspect four provinces. He arranged this assignment for himself so as to visit his disordered estates at the same time and, having picked up his son Anatole (where his regiment was stationed), to go with him to see Prince Nikolai Andreevich Bolkonsky, in order to marry his son to the daughter of this rich old man. But before his departure and these new affairs, Prince Vassily had to decide things with Pierre, who of late had indeed been spending whole days at home, that is, at Prince Vassily�s, where he lived, and who was ridiculous, agitated, and stupid (as a man in love ought to be) in H&#233;l&#232;ne�s presence, but had still not made a proposal.

�Tout &#231;a est bel et bon, mais il faut que &#231;a finisse,� Prince Vassily said to himself one morning with a sad sigh, conscious that Pierre, who owed so much to him (well, Christ be with him!), was not quite acting properly in this matter. �Youth�frivolity�well, God be with him,� thought Prince Vassily, pleasantly aware of his kindness, �mais il faut que &#231;a finisse. The day after tomorrow is Lelya�s name day. I�ll invite people, and if he doesn�t understand what he ought to do, then it will be my business. Yes, my business. I�m a father!�

In the month and a half since Anna Pavlovna�s soir&#233;e, followed by the sleepless, agitated night in which he decided that marriage to H&#233;l&#232;ne would be a misfortune and that he must avoid her and go away, Pierre, after this decision, did not move out of Prince Vassily�s house, and felt with horror that in people�s eyes he was becoming more and more bound to her every day, that he simply could not go back to his former view of her, nor could he tear himself away from her, that it would be terrible, but that he would have to bind his fate to hers. He might perhaps have refrained, but not a day passed without Prince Vassily (who rarely held receptions) having a soir&#233;e at which Pierre had to be present, if he did not want to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyone�s expectations. Prince Vassily, in those rare moments when he was at home, would pass by Pierre, pull his hand downwards, distractedly offer him his clean-shaven, wrinkled cheek to kiss, and say either �See you tomorrow,� or �At dinner, otherwise I won�t see you,� or �I�m staying for your sake,� and so on. But despite the fact that, when Prince Vassily stayed for Pierre�s sake (as he put it), he did not say two words to him, Pierre did not feel himself capable of disappointing his expectations. Every day he said one and the same thing to himself: �I must finally understand her, and find out for myself who she is. Was I mistaken before, or am I mistaken now? No, she�s not stupid; no, she�s a wonderful girl!� he sometimes said to himself. �She�s never mistaken in anything, she never says anything stupid. She speaks little, but what she says is always simple and clear. So she�s not stupid. She�s never been embarrassed and is not embarrassed now. So she�s not a bad woman!� It often happened when he was with her that he would begin to argue, to think aloud, and she responded to that each time either by a brief but appropriate remark, showing that it did not interest her, or by a silent smile and glance, which showed Pierre her superiority most palpably. She was right in considering all arguments as nonsense compared with that smile.

She always addressed him with a joyful, trusting smile, meant for him alone, in which there was something more significant than what was in the general smile that always adorned her face. Pierre knew that everyone was only waiting for him finally to say one word, to cross a certain line, and he knew that sooner or later he would cross it; but some incomprehensible terror seized him at the mere thought of that frightful step. A thousand times in the course of that month and a half, all the while feeling himself drawn more and more into that frightening abyss, Pierre had said to himself: �But what is it? I need resolve. Don�t I have any?�

He wanted to resolve it, but felt with terror that in this case he lacked the resolve that he knew he had and that indeed was in him. Pierre was one of those people who are strong only when they feel themselves perfectly pure. And since the day when he had been possessed by that feeling of desire which he had experienced over the snuffbox at Anna Pavlovna�s, an unconscious feeling of guilt on account of that attraction had paralyzed his resolve.

On H&#233;l&#232;ne�s name day a small company of friends and relations�the closest people, as the princess put it�had supper at Prince Vassily�s. All these friends and relations had been given the feeling that the name-day girl�s lot was to be decided that day. The guests were sitting over supper. Princess Kuragin, a massive, once-beautiful, imposing woman, presided as mistress of the house. On either side of her sat the guests of honor�an old general, his wife, and Anna Pavlovna Scherer; at the end of the table sat the less old and honored guests, and there also, as part of the household, sat Pierre and H&#233;l&#232;ne�next to each other. Prince Vassily did not eat: he strolled around the table in a merry state of mind, sitting down now with one, now with another of the guests. To each he spoke a casual and agreeable word, except for Pierre and H&#233;l&#232;ne, whose presence he seemed not to notice. Prince Vassily enlivened everyone. The wax candles burned brightly, the silver and crystal, the ladies� gowns, and the gold and silver epaulettes shone; servants in red kaftans scurried around the table; the sounds of knives, glasses, plates were heard, and the sounds of animated talk in several conversations around that table. An old chamberlain was heard at one end assuring a little old baroness of his ardent love for her, and so, too, was her laughter; at the other end, the story of the unsuccess of some Marya Viktorovna. At the middle of the table Prince Vassily concentrated listeners around himself. He was telling the ladies, with a jocular smile on his lips, about the latest session�on Wednesday�of the state council, at which Sergei Kuzmich Vyazmitinov, the new military governor general of Petersburg, had received and read the then-famous rescript of the sovereign Alexander Pavlovich from the army, in which the sovereign, addressing Sergei Kuzmich, said that he had received declarations of the people�s devotion from all sides, and that the declaration from Petersburg was especially pleasing to him, that he was proud of the honor of being the head of such a nation and would try to prove worthy of it. The rescript began with the words: �Sergei Kuzmich! From all sides rumors reach me,� and so on.

�So it never went further than �Sergei Kuzmich�?� one lady asked.

�No, no, not a hair�s breadth,� Prince Vassily replied, laughing. ��Sergei Kuzmich�from all sides. From all sides, Sergei Kuzmich.� Poor Vyazmitinov just couldn�t get any further. He took up the letter several more times, but as soon as he said �Sergei��sobs��Ku�zmi�ch��tears�and �from all sides� was drowned in weeping, and he couldn�t go on. And again his handkerchief, and again �Sergei Kuzmich, from all sides,� and tears�so that they finally asked someone else to read it.�

��Kuzmich�from all sides�� and tears,� someone repeated, laughing.

�Don�t be wicked,� Anna Pavlovna said from the other end of the table, shaking her finger, �c�est un si brave et excellent homme notre bon Viasmitinoff��

Everyone laughed a lot. At the upper, honored end of the table, everyone seemed to be merry and under the influence of the most varied, lively moods; only Pierre and H&#233;l&#232;ne silently sat next to each other almost at the lowest end of the table; on both their faces there was a restrained, radiant smile that had nothing to do with Sergei Kuzmich�a smile of bashfulness about their own feelings. Whatever the others said, however they laughed and joked together, whatever the appetite with which they savored the Rhein wine, the saut&#233;, the ice cream, however they avoided glancing at this couple, however indifferent or inattentive to them they seemed, the feeling for some reason was, from the occasional glances cast at them, that the anecdote about Sergei Kuzmich, and the laughter, and the food were all a pretense, and all the power of attention of the entire company was directed only at this couple�Pierre and H&#233;l&#232;ne. Prince Vassily imitated Sergei Kuzmich�s sobbing, and at the same time shot a glance at his daughter; and all the while he laughed, the expression on his face said: �Yes, yes, it�s all going well; tonight it will all be decided.� Anna Pavlovna shook her finger at him for notre bon Viasmitinoff, but in her eyes, which flashed momentarily at Pierre, Prince Vassily read congratulations on his future son-in-law and his daughter�s happiness. The old princess, offering wine with a sad sigh to the lady next to her and glancing angrily at her daughter, seemed to be saying with that sigh: �Yes, now you and I have nothing left but to drink sweet wine, my dear; now it�s time for these young ones to be so boldly and defiantly happy.� �And what stupidity all this that I�m going on about is, as if it interests me,� thought the diplomat, glancing at the happy faces of the lovers. �That is happiness!�

Amidst the insignificant trifles, the artificial interests, that bound this company together, there turned up the simple feeling of attraction of a handsome and healthy young man and woman for each other. And this human feeling overwhelmed everything and soared above all this artifical babble. The jokes were not funny, the news was not interesting, the animation was obviously feigned. Not only they, but the footmen serving at the table seemed to feel the same and forgot the order of the service, gazing at the beauty H&#233;l&#232;ne with her radiant face, and at the red, fat, happy, and uneasy face of Pierre. It seemed that even the light of the candles was concentrated only on those two happy faces.

Pierre felt that he was the center of everything, and this position delighted and embarrassed him. He found himself in the state of a man immersed in some occupation. He neither saw, nor understood, nor heard anything clearly. Only rarely, unexpectedly, did fragmentary thoughts and impressions of reality flash in his soul.

�So it�s all over!� he thought. �And how did it all happen? So quickly! Now I know that, not for her alone, not for me alone, but for all of them, this inevitably had to come about. They all expect this so much, they�re so certain it will be, that I simply cannot disappoint them. But how will it be? I don�t know; but it will be, it will be without fail!� thought Pierre, glancing at those shoulders gleaming just near his eyes.

Then he suddenly became ashamed of something. He felt embarrassed that he alone was taking up everyone�s attention, that he was a lucky fellow in the eyes of others�he, with his unattractive face, some sort of Paris taking possession of Helen. �But surely it always happens that way and must be so,� he comforted himself. �And, anyhow, what did I do for it? When did it begin? I left Moscow along with Prince Vassily. There wasn�t anything yet. And then, why shouldn�t I have stayed with him? Then I played cards with her, picked up her reticule, went for a ride with her. When did it begin, when did it all happen?� And here he is sitting next to her, a fianc&#233; he hears, sees, feels her closeness, her breathing, her movements, her beauty. Now it suddenly seems to him that it is not she but he himself who is so extraordinarily beautiful, that that is why they are looking at him that way, and he, happy in the general astonishment, draws himself up, raises his head, and rejoices at his happiness. Suddenly some voice, someone�s familiar voice, is heard and says something to him yet again. But Pierre is so taken up that he does not understand what is said to him.

�I�m asking you when you got a letter from Bolkonsky,� Prince Vassily repeats for the third time. �You�re so distracted, my dear.�

Prince Vassily smiles, and Pierre sees that everyone, everyone is smiling at him and at H&#233;l&#232;ne. �Well, so what if you all know,� Pierre says to himself. �Well, so what? it�s true,� and he smiles his meek, childlike smile, and H&#233;l&#232;ne smiles, too.

�When did you get it? From Olm&#252;tz?� Prince Vassily repeats, as if he needs to know in order to settle an argument.

�Can one really speak and think about such trifles?� thinks Pierre.

�Yes, from Olm&#252;tz,� he answers with a sigh.

After supper Pierre led his lady after the others to the drawing room. The guests began to depart, and some left without saying good-bye to H&#233;l&#232;ne. As if not wishing to tear her away from her serious occupation, some approached for a moment and left quickly, forbidding her to see them off. The diplomat was sadly silent as he left the drawing room. He was thinking about all the vanity of his diplomatic career compared with Pierre�s happiness. The old general grumbled angrily at his wife when she asked him how his foot was. �Ah, you old fool,� he thought. �Elena Sergeevna, now, she�ll be the same beauty even when she�s fifty.�

�It seems I can congratulate you,� Anna Pavlovna whispered to the princess and kissed her warmly. �If it weren�t for my migraine, I would have stayed.�

The princess said nothing in reply; she was tormented by envy of her daughter�s happiness.

While the guests were taking their leave, Pierre remained alone with H&#233;l&#232;ne for a long time in the small drawing room where they were sitting. Often before, during the last month and a half, he had remained alone with H&#233;l&#232;ne, but he had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that this was necessary, but he simply could not resolve upon this last step. He was ashamed; it seemed to him that here, beside H&#233;l&#232;ne, he was occupying someone else�s place. �This happiness is not for you,� some inner voice was telling him. �This happiness is for those who do not have what you have.� But he had to say something, and so he began to speak. He asked her whether she was pleased with tonight�s soir&#233;e. She answered with her usual simplicity that this name day had been one of the most pleasant for her.

Some of the nearest relations were still there. They were sitting in the big drawing room. Prince Vassily walked lazily over to Pierre. Pierre stood up and said it was already late. Prince Vassily gave him a sternly questioning look, as if what he had said was so strange that he could not even hear it well. But then the expression of sternness changed, and Prince Vassily pulled Pierre�s arm down, seated him, and smiled gently.

�Well, Lelya?� he at once addressed his daughter in that careless tone of habitual tenderness which is adopted by parents who have been affectionate with their children since childhood, but which Prince Vassily only approximated by means of imitating other parents.

And again he turned to Pierre.

��Sergei Kuzmich, from all sides,�� he said, undoing the top button of his waistcoat.

Pierre smiled, but it was clear from his smile that he realized it was not the anecdote about Sergei Kuzmich that interested Prince Vassily just then; and Prince Vassily realized that Pierre realized it. Prince Vassily suddenly burbled something and left. To Pierre it looked as if even Prince Vassily was embarrassed. The sight of this worldly old man�s embarrassment touched Pierre; he glanced at H&#233;l&#232;ne�she, too, seemed embarrassed, and her glance said: �Well, it�s your own fault.�

�I must inevitably cross it, but I can�t, I can�t,� thought Pierre, and again he began talking about unrelated things, about Sergei Kuzmich, asking what the anecdote was, because he had not heard it well. H&#233;l&#232;ne replied with a smile that she did not know either.

When Prince Vassily came into the drawing room, the princess was talking softly with an elderly lady about Pierre.

�Of course, c�est un parti tr&#232;s brilliant, mais le bonheur, ma ch&#232;re��

�Les marriages se font dans les cieux,� the elderly lady replied.

Prince Vassily, as if not listening to the ladies, went to the far corner and sat on the sofa. He closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing. His head began to nod, and he woke up.

�Aline,� he said to his wife, �allez voir ce qu�ils font.�

The princess went to the door, passed by it with a significant, indifferent look, and peeked into the drawing room. Pierre and H&#233;l&#232;ne were sitting and talking in the same way.

�All the same!� she said to her husband.

Prince Vassily frowned, his mouth twisted to one side, his cheeks twitched with an unpleasant, coarse expression peculiar to him; he roused himself, got up, threw his head back, and with a resolute stride walked past the ladies into the small drawing room. He strode quickly, joyfully up to Pierre. The prince�s expression was so extraordinarily joyful that Pierre stood up, frightened, when he saw him.

�Thank God!� he said. �My wife has told me everything.� He embraced Pierre with one arm, his daughter with the other. �Lelya, my friend! I�m very, very glad.� His voice quavered. �I loved your father�and she will be a good wife to you�God bless you!��

He embraced his daughter, then Pierre again, and kissed him with his old man�s mouth. Tears actually wet his cheeks.

�Princess, come here,� he called.

The princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady also dabbed herself with her handkerchief. They kissed Pierre, and he kissed the beautiful H&#233;l&#232;ne�s hand several times. After a while, they were left alone again.

�All this had to be so and could not be otherwise,� thought Pierre, �therefore there�s no point in asking whether it�s good or bad. It�s good because it�s definite, and there�s no more of the old tormenting doubt.� Pierre silently held his fianc&#233;e�s hand and looked at her beautiful breast rising and falling.

�H&#233;l&#232;ne!� he said aloud and stopped.

�Something special is said on these occasions,� he thought, but he simply could not remember precisely what was said on these occasions. He looked at her face. She moved closer to him. Her face blushed.

�Oh, take off those�whatever they�re�� She was pointing to his spectacles.

Pierre took off his spectacles, and his eyes, on top of the general strangeness of people�s eyes when they take off their spectacles, had a frightened and questioning look. He was about to bend down to her hand and kiss it; but she, with a quick and crude movement of her head, intercepted his lips and brought them together with her own. Her face struck Pierre by its altered, unpleasantly perplexed expression.

�It�s too late now, it�s all over; and anyway I love her,� thought Pierre.

�Je vous aime!� he said, having remembered what needed to be said on these occasions; but the words sounded so meager that he felt ashamed of himself.

A month and a half later he was married and settled down, as they say, the happy possessor of a beautiful wife and millions of roubles, in the big, newly done-over house of the counts Bezukhov in Petersburg.


III

Old Prince Nikolai Andreich Bolkonsky received a letter from Prince Vassily in December 1805, informing him of his arrival together with his son. (�I am going to an inspection, and, of course, for me seventy miles is no detour if I can visit you, my much-esteemed benefactor,� he wrote, �and my Anatole is keeping me company on his way to the army; and I hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect which he, in imitation of his father, has for you.�)

�So Marie doesn�t have to be taken out: suitors are coming to us themselves,� the little princess said indiscreetly on hearing of it.

Prince Nikolai Andreich winced and said nothing.

Two weeks after the receipt of the letter, in the evening, Prince Vassily�s people arrived in advance of him, and the next day he himself arrived with his son.

Old Bolkonsky had always had a rather low opinion of Prince Vassily�s character, and the more so in recent times, when Prince Vassily, under the new reigns of Paul and Alexander, had gone far in rank and honors. Now, from the hints in the letter and from the little princess, he understood what the matter was, and the low opinion of Prince Vassily in Prince Nikolai Andreich�s soul turned into a feeling of hostile disdain. He snorted constantly when he spoke of him. On the day of Prince Vassily�s arrival, Prince Nikolai Andreich was especially displeased and ill-humored. Whether he was ill-humored because Prince Vassily was coming, or he was especially displeased with Prince Vassily�s coming because he was ill-humored, in any case he was ill-humored, and already in the morning Tikhon had advised the architect against going to the prince with a report.

�Do you hear how his honor is walking?� Tikhon said, drawing the architect�s attention to the sound of the prince�s footsteps. �Stepping full on his heels�we know about that��

However, as usual, after eight o�clock the prince went out for a walk in his velvet coat with the sable collar and matching hat. It had snowed the day before. The path on which Prince Nikolai Andreich always walked to the conservatory had been cleared, the traces of the broom could be seen on the swept snow, and a shovel was stuck in one of the loosely heaped-up snowbanks that lined both sides of the path. The prince walked through the conservatory, the servants� quarters and outbuildings, frowning and silent.

�But can one get through in a sleigh?� he asked the steward, who accompanied him back to the house, a respectable man, in face and manner resembling his master.

�The snow is deep, Your Excellency. I�ve already ordered it cleared on the avenue.�

The prince inclined his head and went up to the porch. �Thank God,� thought the steward, �the cloud has passed!�

�It would have been hard to get through, Your Excellency,� the steward added. �So we�ve heard, Your Excellency, that a minister is going to be visiting Your Excellency?�

The prince turned to the steward and fixed him with a frowning gaze.

�What? A minister? What minister? Who ordered it?� he began speaking in his piercingly harsh voice. �You didn�t clear it for the princess, my daughter, but for a minister! I have no ministers!�

�Your Excellency, I assumed��

�You assumed!� cried the prince, articulating the words still more hastily and incoherently. �You assumed�Brigands! Knaves!�I�ll teach you to assume.� And, raising his stick, he swung it at Alpatych, and would have hit him, if the steward had not instinctively avoided the blow. �Assumed!�Knaves!�� he shouted hurriedly. But even though Alpatych, frightened by his own boldness in avoiding the blow, approached the prince with his bald head obediently bowed, or perhaps precisely because of it, the prince, while shouting, �Knaves!�Cover the road!��did not raise his stick again and ran inside.

Before dinner the young princess and Mlle Bourienne, knowing that the prince was ill-humored, stood waiting for him, Mlle Bourienne with a beaming face which said: �I know nothing, I�m the same as ever,� and Princess Marya, pale, frightened, with lowered eyes. The hardest thing of all for Princess Marya was that she knew that on these occasions she ought to behave like Mlle Bourienne, but could not do it. She imagined: �If I make as if I don�t notice, he�ll think I have no compassion for him; if I make as if I myself am dull and ill-humored, he�ll say (as has happened) that I�m moping,� and so on.

The prince looked at his daughter�s frightened face and snorted.

�Tra�or a dimwit!�� he said.

�And the other one�s not here! They�ve already spread the gossip,� he thought about the little princess, who was not in the dining room.

�And where is the princess?� he asked. �Hiding?��

�She�s not quite well,� Mlle Bourienne replied with a cheerful smile, �she won�t be coming out. It�s so understandable in her condition.�

�Hem! hem! huff! huff!� said the prince and sat down at the table.

His plate did not seem clean to him; he pointed to a spot and flung it aside. Tikhon caught it and handed it to the butler. The little princess was not unwell; but her fear of the prince was so insuperable that, on learning that he was ill-humored, she decided not to come out.

�I�m afraid for the baby,� she said to Mlle Bourienne, �God knows what fright may do.�

In general, the little princess lived at Bald Hills under a constant feeling of fear and antipathy for the old prince, though she was not aware of the antipathy, because the fear was so predominant that she could not feel it. On the prince�s side there was also antipathy, but it was smothered by contempt. The princess, having made herself at home at Bald Hills, had especially grown to love Mlle Bourienne, spent whole days with her, invited her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her about her father-in-law, criticizing him.

�Il nous arrive du monde, mon prince,� said Mlle Bourienne, unfolding a white napkin with her pink little hands. �Son excellence le prince Kouragine avec son fils, &#224; ce que j�ai entendu dire?� she said questioningly.

�Hm! this excellence is a little brat�I solicited his post for him in the ministry,� the prince said peevishly. �And why the son, I cannot comprehend. Princess Lizaveta Karlovna and Princess Marya may know, but I don�t know why they�re bringing this son here. I have no need of him.� And he looked at his blushing daughter.

�Unwell, are you? Afraid of the minister, as that blockhead Alpatych said today?�

�No, mon p&#232;re.�

Unfortunate as Mlle Bourienne�s choice of subject had been, she did not stop and babbled about the conservatory, about the beauty of a newly opened flower, and after the soup the prince relented.

After dinner he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess was sitting at a small table chatting with the maid Masha. She turned pale when she saw her father-in-law.

The little princess was much changed. She was rather more bad- than good-looking now. Her cheeks sagged, her lip rose up, her eyes were drawn down.

�Yes, a sort of heaviness,� she replied to the prince�s question of how she felt.

�Do you need anything?�

�No, merci, mon p&#232;re.�

�Well, all right, all right.�

He left and went to the servants� room. Alpatych, his head bowed, was standing in the servants� room.

�Has the road been covered?�

�It has, Your Excellency; forgive me, for God�s sake, it was only my stupidity.�

The prince cut him short and laughed his unnatural laugh.

�Well, all right, all right.�

He offered his hand for Alpatych to kiss and went to his study.

In the evening Prince Vassily arrived. He was met on the �avenue� (as they called the front drive) by the coachmen and servants, who with shouts dragged his carts and sleigh to the wing over the road that had been deliberately covered with snow.

Prince Vassily and Anatole were given separate rooms.

Anatole, having taken off his tunic, sat with arms akimbo before a table, at a corner of which, smiling, he directed fixedly and distractedly his beautiful big eyes. He looked upon his whole life as a ceaseless entertainment, which somebody for some reason had taken it upon himself to arrange for him. Now, too, he looked in this way upon his journey to the wicked old man and the rich, ugly heiress. All this, as he supposed, might turn out very nice and amusing. �And why shouldn�t I marry her, if she�s very rich? That never hurts,� thought Anatole.

He shaved, scented himself with a thoroughness and foppishness that had become habitual to him, and with his innately good-humored and triumphant expression, carrying his handsome head high, went into his father�s room. Two valets were bustling around Prince Vassily, dressing him; he himself looked around animatedly and nodded cheerfully to his entering son, as if to say: �Right, that�s how I need you to look!�

�No, without joking, father, is she very ugly? Eh?� he asked in French, as if continuing a conversation they had had more than once during the journey.

�Enough nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and sensible with the old prince.�

�If he starts being abusive, I�ll leave,� said Anatole. �I can�t stand these old men. Eh?�

�Remember, for you everything depends on this.�

By that time in the maids� quarters not only was everything known about the arrival of the minister and his son, but their external appearance had already been described in detail. Princess Marya sat alone in her room, vainly trying to overcome her inner excitement.

�Why did they write, why did Liza tell me about it all? It just can�t be!� she kept saying to herself, looking in the mirror. �How will I come out to the drawing room? Even if I liked him, I couldn�t be myself with him now.� The mere thought of her father�s gaze terrified her.

The little princess and Mlle Bourienne had already received all the necessary information from the maid Masha about what a ruddy, dark-browed, handsome fellow the minister�s son was, and how his papa could barely drag his feet up the stairs, while he, like an eagle, ran up after him taking three steps at a time. On receiving this information, the little princess and Mlle Bourienne, their animatedly chattering voices heard already from the corridor, came into Princess Marya�s room.

�Ils sont arriv&#233;s, Marie, do you know?� said the little princess, waddling in with her belly and lowering herself heavily into an armchair.

She was no longer in the smock she had on that morning, but was wearing one of her best gowns; her hair was carefully done, and in her face there was animation, which, however, did not conceal the sagging and deadened contours of her face. In a costume she used to wear in Petersburg society, it was still more noticeable how far she had lost her good looks. Mlle Bourienne�s costume had also undergone some sort of inconspicuous improvement, which made her fresh, pretty face still more attractive.

�Et bien, et vous restez comme vous &#234;tes, ch&#232;re princesse?� she said. �On va venir annoncer que ces messieurs sont au salon; il faudra descendre, et vous ne faites pas un petit brin de toilette!�

The little princess got up from the armchair, rang for the maid, and began hurriedly and cheerfully devising a costume for Princess Marya and carrying it out. Princess Marya felt insulted in her sense of her own dignity, because the arrival of the promised suitor excited her, and she was still more insulted that her two friends did not suppose it could be otherwise. To tell them how ashamed she was of herself and of them would mean to betray her excitement; besides, to refuse the dressing-up they suggested would lead to prolonged bantering and insistence. She flushed, her beautiful eyes faded, her face became covered with blotches, and, with that unattractive expression of a victim which most often lingered on her face, she gave herself into the power of Mlle Bourienne and Liza. The two women concerned themselves in all sincerity with making her beautiful. She was so plain that the thought of rivalry with her did not occur to either of them; they therefore undertook to dress her up in all sincerity, with that na&#239;ve and firm conviction of women that clothes can make a face beautiful.

�No, really, ma bonne amie, this dress won�t do,� Liza said, looking sideways at the princess from a distance, �have them bring the maroon one you�ve got there! Really! Why, this may just be the deciding of your fate in life. And this is too light, it won�t do, no, it won�t do!�

What would not do was not the dress, but the face and the whole figure of the princess, but neither Mlle Bourienne nor the little princess sensed that; it seemed to them that if a blue ribbon was put in the hair, done up high, and a blue scarf hung down on the brown dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot that the frightened face and figure could not be changed, and therefore, no matter how they changed the frame and decoration of that face, the face itself remained pitiful and unattractive. After two or three changes, to which Princess Marya submitted obediently, when her hair had been done up high (a style that totally changed and spoiled her face), and she was wearing the blue scarf and fancy maroon gown, the little princess walked around her twice, straightened a fold here, pulled at the scarf there with her little hand, and, inclining her head, looked now from this side, now from that.

�No, it�s impossible,� she said resolutely, clasping her hands. �Non, Marie, d&#233;cid&#233;ment, &#231;a ne vous va pas. Je vous aime mieux dans votre petite robe grise de tout les jours. Non, de gr&#226;ce, faites cela pour moi. Katya,� she said to the maid, �bring the princess her little gray dress, and watch, Mlle Bourienne, how I�m going to arrange it,� she said, with a smiling foretaste of artistic delight.

But when Katya brought the dress requested, Princess Marya was still sitting motionless before the mirror, looking at her face, and saw in the mirror that tears had welled up in her eyes and her mouth was trembling, getting ready to weep.

�Voyons, ch&#232;re princesse,� said Mlle Bourienne, �encore un petit effort.�

The little princess, taking the dress from the maid�s hands, was approaching Princess Marya.

�No, now we�ll make it simple and sweet,� she said.

Her voice, Mlle Bourienne�s, and Katya�s, who was laughing about something, blended into a merry warbling which resembled the song of birds.

�Non, laissez-moi,� said the princess.

And there was so much seriousness and suffering in her voice that the birds� warbling immediately ceased. They looked at her big, beautiful eyes, filled with tears and thought, looking at them clearly and pleadingly, and understood that to insist would be useless and even cruel.

�Au moins changez la coiffure,� said the little princess. �Je vous disais,� she said with reproach, turning to Mlle Bourienne, �Marie a une de ces figures, auxquelles ce genre de coiffure ne vas pas du tout. Mais du tout, du tout. Changez de gr&#226;ce.�

�Laissez-moi, laissez-moi, tout &#231;a m�est parfaitement &#233;gal,� answered a voice barely holding back its tears.

Mlle Bourienne and the little princess had to confess to themselves that as she was Princess Marya looked very bad, worse than ever; but it was already late. She looked at them with that expression they knew, an expression of thought and sadness. This expression did not inspire any fear of Princess Marya in them. (She never inspired that feeling in anyone.) But they knew that when that expression appeared on her face, she became silent and unshakeable in her decisions.

�Vous changerez, n�est-ce pas?� said Liza, and when Princess Marya made no reply, Liza left the room.

Princess Marya remained alone. She did not carry out Liza�s wish, and not only did not change her hairstyle, but did not even look at herself in the mirror. Strengthlessly lowering her eyes and arms, she sat silently and thought. She imagined a husband, a man, a strong, dominating, and incomprehensibly attractive being, suddenly carrying her off into his own completely different, happy world. Her own baby, like the one she had seen yesterday at her nurse�s daughter�s�she imagined at her own breast. The husband stands and looks tenderly at her and the baby. �But no, it�s impossible, I�m too plain,� she thought.

�Please come to tea. The prince will come out shortly,� said the maid�s voice outside the door.

She roused herself and was horrified at what she had been thinking. And before going downstairs, she stood up, went to her icon room, and, fixing her eyes on the dark lamp-lit face of a large icon of the Savior, stood before it with clasped hands for several minutes. There was tormenting doubt in Princess Marya�s soul. Was the joy of love, of earthly love for a man, possible for her? Thinking of marriage, Princess Marya dreamed of family happiness and children, but her chiefest, strongest, and most secret dream was of earthly love. This feeling was all the stronger, the more she tried to conceal it from others and even from herself. �My God,� she said, �how can I suppress these devil�s thoughts in my heart? How can I renounce evil imaginings forever, so as peacefully to do Thy will?� And she had barely asked this question, when God answered her in her own heart: �Desire nothing for yourself; do not seek, do not worry, do not envy. The future of people and your own fate must be unknown to you; but live so as to be ready for anything. If God should see fit to test you in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill His will.� With this reassuring thought (but still with a hope that her forbidden earthly dream would be fulfilled), Princess Marya sighed, crossed herself, and went downstairs without thinking about her dress, or her hairstyle, or how she would walk in, or what she would say. What could all that mean in comparison with the predestination of God, without whose will not one hair falls from man�s head.


IV

When Princess Marya came in, Prince Vassily and his son were already in the drawing room, talking with the little princess and Mlle Bourienne. When she came in with her heavy step, planting her heels, the men and Mlle Bourienne rose, and the little princess, pointing to her, said, �Voil&#224; Marie!� Princess Marya saw them all, and saw them in detail. She saw the face of Prince Vassily, momentarily freezing in a serious expression at the sight of the princess, and the face of the little princess, curiously reading on the faces of the guests the impression Marie made. She also saw Mlle Bourienne with her ribbon, and her beautiful face, and her gaze�lively as never before�directed at him; but she could not see him, she saw only something big, bright, and beautiful, which moved towards her as she came into the room. Prince Vassily went up to her first, and she kissed the bald head that bowed over her hand, and to his words replied that, on the contrary, she remembered him very well. Then Anatole came up to her. She still did not see him. She only felt a gentle hand firmly take hold of her hand, and barely touched the white forehead with beautiful, pomaded blond hair above it. When she looked at him, his beauty struck her. Anatole, the thumb of his right hand placed behind a fastened button of his uniform, chest thrust out, shoulders back, swinging his free leg slightly, and inclining his head a little, gazed silently and cheerfully at the princess, obviously without thinking of her at all. Anatole was not resourceful, not quick and eloquent in conversation, but he had instead a capacity, precious in society, for composure and unalterable assurance. When an insecure man is silent at first acquaintance and shows an awareness of the impropriety of this silence and a wish to find something to say, it comes out badly; but Anatole was silent, swung his leg, and cheerfully observed the princess�s hairstyle. It was clear that he could calmly remain silent like that for a very long time. �If anyone feels awkward because of this silence, speak up, but I don�t care to,� his look seemed to say. Besides that, in Anatole�s behavior with women there was a manner which more than any other awakens women�s curiosity, fear, and even love�a manner of contemptuous awareness of his own superiority. As if he were saying to them with his look: �I know you, I know, but why should I bother with you? And you�d be glad if I did!� Perhaps he did not think that when he met women (and it is even probable that he did not, because he generally thought little), but such was his look and manner. The princess felt it, and, as if wishing to show him that she dared not even think of interesting him, turned to the old prince. The conversation was general and lively, thanks to the little princess�s voice and the lip with its little mustache which kept rising up over her white teeth. She met Prince Vassily in that jocular mode often made use of by garrulously merry people, which consists in the fact that, between the person thus addressed and oneself, there are supposed to exist some long-established jokes and merry, amusing reminiscences, not known to everyone, when in fact there are no such reminiscences, as there were none between the little princess and Prince Vassily. Prince Vassily readily yielded to this tone; the little princess also involved Anatole, whom she barely knew, in this reminiscence of never-existing funny incidents. Mlle Bourienne also shared in these common reminiscences, and even Princess Marya enjoyed feeling herself drawn into this merry reminiscence.

�So at least we can make full use of you now, dear Prince,� the little princess said, in French, of course, to Prince Vassily. �It won�t be as at our soir&#233;es at Annette�s, where you always run away. Remember cette ch&#232;re Annette!�

�Ah, but you won�t go talking politics with me, like Annette!�

�And our little tea table?�

�Oh, yes!�

�Why did you never come to Annette�s?� the little princess asked Anatole. �Ah! I know, I know,� she said, winking, �your brother Ippolit has told me about your affairs. Oh!� she shook her finger at him. �I even know your Parisian pranks!�

�But he, Ippolit, didn�t he tell you?� said Prince Vassily, turning to his son and seizing the princess by the hand as if she was about to run away and he had barely managed to hold her back, �didn�t he tell you how he himself, Ippolit, pined for the dear princess and how she le mettait &#224; la porte? Oh! C�est la perle des femmes, princesse!� he said, turning to Princess Marya.

For her part, Mlle Bourienne did not miss her chance, at the word Paris, to enter as well into the general conversation of reminiscences.

She permitted herself to ask whether Anatole had left Paris long ago and how he liked the city. Anatole answered the Frenchwoman quite willingly and, gazing at her with a smile, conversed with her about her fatherland. Seeing the pretty Bourienne, Anatole decided that even here, at Bald Hills, it would not be boring. �Not bad at all!� he thought, looking her over. �She�s not bad at all, this demoiselle de compagnie. I hope she�ll bring her along when she marries me,� he thought, �la petite est gentille.�

The old prince was dressing unhurriedly in his study, frowning and thinking over what he was going to do. The arrival of these guests angered him. �What are Prince Vassily and his boy to me? Prince Vassily�s an empty babbler, so the son must also be a fine one,� he grumbled to himself. He was angry because the arrival of these guests raised in his soul an unresolved, constantly stifled question�a question in regard to which the old prince always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever resolve to part with Princess Marya and give her to a husband. The prince had never ventured to ask himself this question directly, knowing beforehand that he would answer it in all fairness, and fairness contradicted more than feeling, it contradicted the whole possibility of his life. For Prince Nikolai Andreich, life without Princess Marya, despite the fact that he seemed to value her little, was unthinkable. �And why should she marry?� he thought. �She�s sure to be unhappy. Liza�s married to Andrei (a better husband would seem hard to find these days), but is she pleased with her fate? And who�s going to take her out of love? She�s plain, awkward. She�ll be taken for her connections, for her wealth. Don�t girls live unmarried? And all the happier!� So thought Prince Nikolai Andreich as he dressed, but at the same time the ever-deferred question called for immediate resolution. Prince Vassily had obviously brought his son with the intention of making a proposal, and would probably ask for a direct answer today or tomorrow. His name, his position in society were decent. �Well, I�m not against it,� the prince said to himself, �but he must be worthy of her. We�ll see about that.�

�We�ll see about that,� he said aloud. �We�ll see about that.�

And with brisk steps, as usual, he entered the drawing room, took everyone in with a quick glance, noticed the little princess�s change of dress, the ribbon on Bourienne, and Princess Marya�s ugly hairstyle, and the smiles of Bourienne and Anatole, and his daughter�s solitude amidst the general conversation. �Got herself up like a fool!� he thought, looking spitefully at his daughter. �No shame! And he doesn�t even want to know her!�

He went over to Prince Vassily.

�Well, greetings, greetings; glad to see you.�

�For a dear friend, no detour�s too long,� Prince Vassily began, as usual, quickly, self-confidently, and familiarly. �Here is my second one, I recommend him to your loving kindness.�

Prince Nikolai Andreevich looked Anatole over.

�A fine boy, a fine boy!� he said. �Well, come and kiss me.� And he offered him his cheek.

Anatole kissed the old man, then looked at him curiously and with perfect calm, expecting him to come out with something eccentric, as his father had promised.

Prince Nikolai Andreevich sat in his usual place at the end of the sofa, moved a chair for Prince Vassily towards him, pointed to it, and began asking questions about political matters and the latest news. He listened as if with attention to Prince Vassily�s account, but kept glancing at Princess Marya.

�So they�re already writing from Potsdam?� he repeated Prince Vassily�s last words, suddenly stood up, and went over to his daughter.

�So you�ve spruced yourself up like that for the guests, eh?� he said. �Fine, very fine. You do your hair up in some new way for the guests, but I say to you in front of the guests that in future you dare not change anything without my permission.�

�Mon p&#232;re, it�s my fault,� the little princess intervened, blushing.

�That�s entirely as you will, ma�am,� said Prince Nikolai Andreevich, bowing and scraping before his daughter-in-law, �but she needn�t make herself ugly�she�s plain enough as it is.�

And he sat down in his place again, paying no further attention to the daughter he had driven to tears.

�On the contrary, this hairstyle is very becoming to the princess,� said Prince Vassily.

�Well, my good fellow, young prince what�s your name?� said Prince Nikolai Andreevich, turning to Anatole, �come here, let�s talk, let�s get acquainted.�

�Now the fun begins,� thought Anatole and, smiling, he took a seat nearer to the old prince.

�Well, now, they say, my dear, that you were educated abroad. Not like your father and me, who were taught to read by the beadle. Tell me, my dear, you�re now serving in the horse guards?� the old man asked, studying Anatole closely and intently.

�No, I�ve been transferred to the infantry,� replied Anatole, barely able to keep from laughing.

�Ah! a good thing. So, my dear, you want to serve your tsar and country? It�s wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve, must serve. So, off to the front?�

�No, Prince. Our regiment is already on the march. But I�m enlisted�what am I enlisted in, papa?� Anatole turned with a laugh to his father.

�Nice service, very nice. What am I enlisted in! Ha, ha, ha!� Prince Nikolai Andreevich laughed.

And Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly Prince Nikolai Andreevich frowned.

�Well, go,� he said to Anatole.

Anatole, with a smile, went back to the ladies.

�So you did educate them abroad, Prince Vassily? Eh?� The old prince turned to Prince Vassily.

�I did what I could; and I�ll tell you, the education there is much better than ours.�

�Yes, everything�s different nowadays, everything�s the new way. A fine lad, though! A fine lad! Well, come with me.�

He took Prince Vassily under the arm and led him to his study.

Prince Vassily, finding himself alone with the prince, at once declared to him his wishes and hopes.

�And what do you think,� the old prince said gruffly, �that I�m holding on to her, that I can�t part with her? People imagine things!� he pronounced gruffly. �She can marry tomorrow! Only I�ll tell you, I�d like to know my son-in-law better. You know my rules: everything�s in the open! I�ll ask her tomorrow in your presence: if she wants, let him stay a while. Let him stay, and I�ll see.� The prince snorted. �Let her marry him, it�s all the same to me,� he shrieked in the same shrill voice in which he had shouted on taking leave of his son.

�I�ll tell you straight out,� said Prince Vassily, in the tone of a cunning man convinced that it is unnecessary to use cunning in view of his interlocutor�s perceptiveness. �You see through people. Anatole is no genius, but he�s an honest, good lad, an excellent son, and one of us.�

�Well, well, all right, we�ll see.�

As always happens with lonely women who have long lived without the society of men, on Anatole�s appearance all three women in Prince Nikolai Andreevich�s house felt equally that their life had not been life until that moment. The power of thought, feeling, observation instantly increased tenfold in them, as if their life, going on in darkness till then, was suddenly lit up by a new light filled with meaning.

Princess Marya did not think at all or even remember about her face and hairstyle. The handsome, open face of the man who would perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention. To her he seemed kind, brave, resolute, manly, and magnanimous. She was convinced of it. Thousands of fancies of her future family life kept emerging in her imagination. She drove them away and tried to hide them.

�But am I not too cold with him?� thought Princess Marya. �I�m trying to restrain myself, because deep in my soul I feel myself already too close to him; but he doesn�t know all that I�m thinking about him and may imagine that I find him disagreeable.�

And Princess Marya tried and was unable to be cordial with the new guest.

�La pauvre fille! Elle est diablement laide,� thought Anatole.

Mlle Bourienne, whom Anatole�s arrival had also brought to a high level of excitement, was thinking along different lines. Of course, the beautiful young woman, with no definite position in the world, with no family or friends or even country, did not intend to devote her life to serving Prince Nikolai Andreevich, reading books to him, or being friends with Princess Marya. Mlle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who would at once be able to appreciate her superiority over the plain, badly dressed, awkward Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her off; and this Russian prince had finally come. Mlle Bourienne had a story, heard from her aunt, completed by herself, which she liked to tell over in her imagination. It was a story about a seduced girl, whose poor mother, sa pauvre m&#232;re, appeared to her in a vision and reproached her for giving herself to a man outside wedlock. Mlle Bourienne often brought herself to tears, telling him, the seducer, this story in her imagination. Now he, this real Russian prince, had come. He will carry her off, then ma pauvre m&#232;re will appear, and he will marry her. Thus the whole future story of Mlle Bourienne had taken shape in her head while she was talking with him about Paris. Mlle Bourienne was not guided by calculation (she did not spend a moment thinking of what she was to do), but it had all been long prepared in her and now merely arranged itself around the visiting Anatole, whom she wished and strove to please as much as she could.

The little princess, like an old warhorse hearing the sound of trumpets, was preparing herself, unconsciously and forgetting her condition, for her habitual coquettish gallop, without any second thoughts or struggles, but with na&#239;ve, light-minded merriment.

Although Anatole, in women�s company, usually placed himself in the position of a man who is sick of having women running after him, he took a vain pleasure in seeing his effect on these three women. Besides, he was beginning to experience for the pretty and provocative Bourienne that passionate, animal feeling which came over him with extraordinary quickness and urged him towards the most coarse and bold actions.

After tea the company went to the sitting room, and the princess was asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole leaned on his elbow before her next to Mlle Bourienne, and his eyes, laughing and joyful, looked at Princess Marya. Princess Marya felt his gaze upon her with tormenting and joyful excitement. Her favorite sonata transported her into her innermost poetic world, and the gaze she felt upon her endowed that world with still greater poetry. Anatole�s gaze, though directed at her, referred not to her but to the movements of Mlle Bourienne�s little foot, which he touched just then with his own foot under the pianoforte. Mlle Bourienne was also looking at the princess, and in her beautiful eyes there was an expression of frightened joy and hope which was also new for Princess Marya.

�How she loves me!� thought Princess Marya. �How happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Can it be�a husband?� she thought, not daring to look up at his face, still feeling that same gaze directed at her.

In the evening, when they all began to disperse after supper, Anatole kissed Princess Marya�s hand. She did not know herself how she had boldness enough, but she glanced straight at the beautiful face as it approached her nearsighted eyes. After the princess, he went to kiss Mlle Bourienne�s hand (this was improper, but he did everything so confidently and simply), and Mlle Bourienne blushed and glanced fearfully at the princess.

�Quelle d&#233;licatesse!� thought the princess. �Can Am&#233;lie� (that was Mlle Bourienne�s name) �really think I could be jealous of her and not appreciate her pure affection for and devotion to me?� She went over to Mlle Bourienne and kissed her warmly. Anatole went to kiss the little princess�s hand.

�Non, non, non! Quand votre p&#232;re m�&#233;crira, que vous vous conduisez bien, je vous donnerai ma main &#224; baiser. Pas avant.�

And, raising her finger and smiling, she left the room.


V

They all dispersed and, except for Anatole, who fell asleep as soon as he lay down, it was long before anyone slept that night.

�Can it be that he�s my husband, precisely this stranger, this handsome, kind man�above all, kind,� thought Princess Marya, and fear, which hardly ever came to her, came over her now. She was afraid to look around; she fancied someone was standing there behind the screen, in the dark corner. And that someone was he�the devil�and he was this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red mouth.

She rang for the maid and asked her to sleep in her room.

Mlle Bourienne spent a long time that evening walking in the winter garden, vainly waiting for someone and now smiling at someone, now waxing tearful, touched in her imagination by the words of sa pauvre m&#232;re reproaching her for her fall.

The little princess grumbled at her maid because the bed was not right. It was impossible for her to lie either on her side or on her front. Everything was heavy and awkward. Her belly got in her way. It got in her way more than ever precisely today, because Anatole�s presence transported her more vividly into another time, when it was not there, and everything was light and merry for her. She sat in an armchair in her bed-jacket and nightcap. Katya, sleepy and with her braid tangled, plumped up and turned the heavy featherbed for the third time, muttering something.

�I told you, it�s all bumps and hollows,� the little princess repeated. �I�d be glad to fall asleep myself, so it�s not my fault.� And her voice quavered, like the voice of a child who is about to cry.

The old prince was also awake. Tikhon, through his sleep, heard him pacing about angrily and snorting through his nose. It seemed to the old prince that he was offended for his daughter. The offense was most painful because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he loved more than himself. He told himself that he would think over the whole matter again and find what was fair and ought to be done, but instead he only irritated himself more.

�The first comer turns up�and her father and everything�s forgotten, and she runs, does her hair up, and wags her tail, and isn�t like herself at all! Glad to abandon her father! She knew I�d notice. Snort�snort�snort�As if I don�t see that this fool is only looking at Bourrienka (she must be thrown out)! And how can she not have enough pride to realize it! If she has no pride for herself, at least she could have it for me. She must be shown that that blockhead doesn�t even give her a thought, but is only looking at Bourienne. She has no pride, but I�ll show her that she��

By telling his daughter that she was mistaken, that Anatole intended to pay court to Bourienne, the old prince knew he would rouse Princess Marya�s amour propre, and his cause (the wish not to part with his daughter) would be won, and that calmed him down. He called Tikhon and began to undress.

�The devil brought them here!� he thought, as Tikhon slipped a nightgown over his dry old man�s body, the chest overgrown with gray hair. �I didn�t invite them. They�ve come to upset my life. And there�s not much left of it.�

�Devil take them!� he said, while the shirt still covered his head.

Tikhon knew the prince�s habit of sometimes expressing his thoughts aloud, and therefore with an unchanged face met the irately questioning gaze of the face that emerged from the shirt.

�Gone to bed?� asked the prince.

Tikhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew his master�s train of thought. He guessed that he was being asked about Prince Vassily and his son.

�They�ve gone to bed and put out the lights, if you please, Your Excellency.�

�No need, no need�� the prince said quickly and, putting his feet into his slippers and his arms through the sleeves of his dressing gown, he went to the sofa on which he slept.

Though nothing had yet been said between Anatole and Mlle Bourienne, they understood each other perfectly in regard to the first part of the romance, before the appearance of the pauvre m&#232;re, understood that they had much to tell each other in secret, and therefore in the morning they both sought an occasion to see each other alone. When Princess Marya went at the usual hour to see her father, Mlle Bourienne met with Anatole in the winter garden.

Princess Marya came to her father�s door that day with particular trepidation. It seemed to her not only that everyone knew her fate was to be decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She read that expression on the face of Tikhon, and on the face of Prince Vassily�s valet, who met her in the corridor while carrying hot water and bowed low to her.

The old prince was extremely gentle and painstaking in dealing with his daughter that morning. Princess Marya knew this painstaking expression of her father�s very well. It was the expression he had on his face in the moments when his dry hands clenched into fists from vexation at Princess Marya�s not understanding a problem in arithmetic, and, getting up, he would step away from her and in a soft voice repeat the same words several times.

He got down to business straightaway and began the conversation in a formal tone.

�A proposal has been made to me concerning you, miss,� he said, smiling unnaturally. �You have guessed, I believe,� he went on, �that Prince Vassily came here and brought with him his pupil� (for some reason Prince Nikolai Andreich called Anatole a pupil), �not just for my good pleasure. A proposal was made to me yesterday concerning you. And since you know my rules, I am referring it to you.�

�How am I to understand you, mon p&#232;re?� said the princess, turning pale, then red.

�How understand!� her father cried irately. �Prince Vassily finds you to his taste as his daughter-in-law and proposes to you on behalf of his pupil. That�s how! How understand?! And I am asking you.�

�I don�t know, mon p&#232;re, how you�� the princess said in a whisper.

�I? I? What have I got to do with it? Leave me out of it. It�s not I who am getting married. What about you, miss? That�s what it�s desirable to know.�

The princess saw that her father looked unfavorably on this matter, but at the same moment it occurred to her that her fate in life would be decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see his gaze, under the influence of which she felt she could not think but only obey out of habit, and said:

�I desire only one thing�to do your will,� she said, �but if my desire must needs be expressed��

She did not have time to finish. The prince interrupted her.

�Splendid!� he cried. �He�ll get you and your dowry and incidentally take along Mlle Bourienne. She�ll be his wife, and you��

The prince stopped. He noticed the impression these words made on his daughter. She hung her head and was about to cry.

�Well, well, I�m joking, I�m joking,� he said. �Remember one thing, Princess: I hold to the rule that a girl has the full right to choose. And I give you freedom. Remember one thing: the happiness of your life depends on your decision. There�s no point in talking about me.�

�But I don�t know�mon p&#232;re.�

�There�s no point in talking! They�ll tell him, and he�ll marry not only you but anyone else as well; but you�re free to choose�Go to your room, think it over, and in an hour come to me and say in his presence: yes or no. I know you�ll be praying. Well, pray then. Only you�d better think. Now go.�

�Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!� he went on shouting, once the princess, reeling as if in a fog, had left his study.

Her fate was decided and decided happily. But what her father had said about Mlle Bourienne�that was a terrible hint. Untrue, let us suppose, but all the same it was terrible, she could not help thinking about it. She was walking straight ahead through the winter garden without seeing or hearing anything, when suddenly the familiar whispering of Mlle Bourienne roused her. She looked up and saw Anatole two steps away from her, embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her. Anatole, with a frightful expression on his handsome face, turned to look at Princess Marya, and for the first second did not let go of the waist of Mlle Bourienne, who did not see her.

�Who�s there? Why? Wait!� Anatole�s face seemed to say. Princess Marya was looking at them silently. She could not understand it. Finally Mlle Bourienne gave a little cry and ran away. Anatole, with a merry smile, bowed to Princess Marya, as if inviting her to laugh at this odd incident, and, shrugging his shoulders, went to the door that led to his part of the house.

An hour later Tikhon came to summon Princess Marya. He summoned her to the prince and added that Prince Vassily Sergeich was also there. When Tikhon came, the princess was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping Mlle Bourienne in her arms. Princess Marya was gently stroking her head. Her beautiful eyes, with all their former calm and luminosity, looked at the pretty face of Mlle Bourienne with tender love and pity.

�Non, princesse, je suis perdue pour toujours dans votre coeur,� said Mlle Bourienne.

�Pourquoi? Je vous aime plus que jamais,� said Princess Marya, �et je t&#226;cherai de faire tout ce qui est en mon pouvoir pour votre bonheur.�

�Mais vous me m&#233;prisez, vous si pure, vous ne comprendrez jamais cet &#233;garement de la passion. Ah, ce n�est que ma pauvre m&#232;re��

�Je comprends tout,� Princess Marya answered with a sad smile. �Calm down, my friend. I�ll go to my father,� she said and went out.

Prince Vassily, one leg crossed high up on the other, a snuffbox in his hand, as if moved to the utmost, and as if regretting and laughing at his sentimentality himself, was sitting with a smile of tender emotion on his face. When Princess Marya came in, he quickly brought a pinch of snuff to his nose.

�Ah, ma bonne, ma bonne,� he said, rising and taking her by both hands. He sighed and added: �Le sort de mon fils est en vos mains. D&#233;cidez, ma bonne, ma ch&#232;re, ma douce Marie, qui j�ai toujours aim&#233; comme ma fille.�

He stepped aside. An actual tear came to his eye.

�Snort�snort�� snorted Prince Nikolai Andreich.

�The prince, on behalf of his pupil�son, is proposing to you. Do you or do you not want to be the wife of Prince Anatole Kuragin? Say yes or no!� he shouted, �and then I retain my right to give my opinion as well. Yes, my opinion and only my opinion,� added Prince Nikolai Andreich, turning to Prince Vassily and replying to his pleading expression. �Yes or no? Well?�

�My wish, mon p&#232;re, is never to leave you, never to separate my life from yours. I do not want to marry,� she said resolutely, her beautiful eyes looking at Prince Vassily and her father.

�Rot! Foolishness! Rot, rot, rot!� shouted Prince Nikolai Andreich, frowning, and taking his daughter by the hand, he pulled her to him and did not kiss her, but, leaning his forehead to her forehead, touched it, and squeezed her hand, which he was holding, so hard that she winced and cried out.

Prince Vassily rose.

�Ma ch&#232;re, je vous dirai, que c�est un moment que je n�oublierai jamais, jamais; mais, ma bonne, est-ce que vous ne nous donnerez pas un peu d�esp&#233;rance de toucher ce coeur si bon, si g&#233;n&#233;reux? Dites, que peut-&#234;tre�L�avenir est si grand. Dites: peut-&#234;tre.�

�Prince, what I said is all that is in my heart. I thank you for the honor, but I shall never be your son�s wife.�

�Well, that ends that, my dear. Very glad to see you, very glad to see you. Go to your room, Princess, go,� said the old prince. �Very, very glad to see you,� he repeated, putting his arm around Prince Vassily.

�My calling is different,� Princess Marya thought to herself, �my calling is to be happy with a different happiness, the happiness of love and self-sacrifice. And whatever the cost, I shall make for poor Am&#233;lie�s happiness. She loves him so passionately. She repents so passionately. I shall do everything to arrange her marriage to him. If he is not rich, I shall give her means. I shall ask father, and ask Andrei. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so unhappy, a stranger, lonely, helpless! And, my God, how passionately she loves him, if she could so forget herself. I might have done the same!�� thought Princess Marya.


VI

For a long time the Rostovs had no news of Nikolushka; only in midwinter was the count handed a letter addressed in what he recognized as his son�s handwriting. On receiving the letter, the count fearfully and hastily, trying not to be noticed, ran on tiptoe to his study, shut himself in, and began to read. Anna Mikhailovna, learning (as she knew everything that went on in the house) of the letter that had come, went into the count�s study with soft steps, and found him with the letter in his hands, sobbing and laughing at the same time.

Anna Mikhailovna, though her affairs had improved, went on living with the Rostovs.

�Mon bon ami?� Anna Mikhailovna uttered with questioning sadness and a readiness for all sorts of sympathy.

The count sobbed still louder.

�Nikolushka�a letter�wounded�wa�was�ma ch&#232;re�wounded�my darling boy�my little countess�promoted to officer�thank God�How shall I tell my little countess?��

Anna Mikhailovna sat down beside him, took her handkerchief, wiped the tears from his eyes, the letter stained by them, and her own tears, read the letter, reassured the count, and decided that she would prepare the countess over dinner and before tea, and after tea would announce everything, with God�s help.

All through dinner, Anna Mikhailovna talked about rumors of the war, about Nikolushka; she asked twice when the last letter had come from him, though she already knew, and observed that a letter could very easily come that day. Each time these hints made the countess begin to worry and look anxiously now at the count, now at Anna Mikhailovna, Anna Mikhailovna quite imperceptibly turned the conversation to insignificant subjects. Natasha, the best endowed of all the family with the ability to detect the nuances of intonations, glances, and facial expressions, had pricked up her ears since the beginning of dinner, and knew that there was something between her father and Anna Mikhailovna, and something concerning her brother, and that Anna Mikhailovna was making preparations. In spite of all her boldness (Natasha knew how sensitive her mother was to everything that had to do with news of Nikolushka), she did not venture to ask any questions during dinner, and ate nothing from anxiousness, and fidgeted on her chair, not listening to her governess�s reproaches. After dinner, she rushed headlong after Anna Mikhailovna and threw herself on her neck at full speed in the sitting room.

�Auntie, darling, tell me, what is it?�

�Nothing, my friend.�

�No, my darling, my dear heart, my honey, my peach, I won�t let go, I know you know something.�

Anna Mikhailovna shook her head.

�Vous &#234;tes une fine mouche, mon enfant,� she said.

�A letter from Nikolenka? Surely!� cried Natasha, reading the affirmative answer in Anna Mikhailovna�s face.

�But for God�s sake be more careful: you know what a shock it may give your maman.�

�I will, I will be, but tell me. You won�t? Then I�ll go and tell her now.�

Anna Mikhailovna briefly recounted to Natasha the contents of the letter, on condition that she not tell anyone.

�My noble word of honor,� said Natasha, crossing herself, �I won�t tell anyone��and she immediately ran to Sonya.

�Nikolenka�wounded�a letter�� she said solemnly and joyfully.

�Nicolas!� Sonya merely said, instantly turning pale.

Seeing the impression the news of her brother�s wound made on Sonya, Natasha felt for the first time the whole grievous side of this news.

She rushed to Sonya, embraced her, and wept.

�Slightly wounded, but promoted to officer; he�s recovered now, he wrote himself,� she said through her tears.

�It�s obvious all you women are crybabies,� said Petya, pacing the room in big, resolute strides. �I�m very glad, really very glad, that my brother has distinguished himself. You�re all blubberers! You understand nothing.�

Natasha smiled through her tears.

�You haven�t read the letter?� asked Sonya.

�No, I haven�t, but she said it�s all over and he�s already an officer��

�Thank God,� said Sonya, crossing herself. �But maybe she deceived you? Let�s go to maman.�

Petya silently paced the room.

�If I were in Nikolushka�s place, I�d have killed even more of those Frenchmen,� he said, �they�re so disgusting! I�d have cut down so many, there�d be a whole pile,� Petya went on.

�Shut up, Petya, what a fool you are!��

�I�m not a fool, the fools are the ones who cry over trifles,� said Petya.

�Do you remember him?� Natasha suddenly asked, after a moment�s silence. Sonya smiled.

�Do I remember Nicolas?�

�No, Sonya, do you remember him so as to remember everything, remember really well,� said Natasha, with an assiduous gesture, evidently wishing to give her words the most serious meaning. �I remember Nikolenka, too, I do,� she said. �But not Boris. I don�t remember him at all.�

�What? You don�t remember Boris?� Sonya asked in surprise.

�It�s not that I don�t remember him�I know how he is, but I don�t remember him the way I do Nikolenka. I close my eyes, and I remember him, but Boris I don�t� (she closed her eyes), �no�nothing!�

�Ah, Natasha!� Sonya said rapturously and seriously, without looking at her friend, as if she considered her unworthy of what she intended to say, and as if she was saying it to someone else, with whom it was impossible to joke. �I�ve fallen in love with your brother once and for all, and whatever happens to him, or to me, I will never stop loving him�all my life.�

Natasha looked at Sonya with astonished, curious eyes and said nothing. She felt that what Sonya had said was true, that there was such love as Sonya was talking about; but Natasha had never experienced anything like that. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.

�Will you write to him?� she asked.

Sonya fell to thinking. The question of how to write to Nicolas, and whether she should write to him, was a question that tormented her. Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right on her part to remind him of herself and, as it were, of the commitment he had taken upon himself in her regard.

�I don�t know; I think, since he writes, I�ll write, too,� she said, blushing.

�And you won�t be ashamed to write to him?�

Sonya smiled.

�No.�

�But I�d be ashamed to write to Boris, so I won�t.�

�Ashamed of what?�

�Just so, I don�t know. Awkward, ashamed.�

�But I know why she�d be ashamed,� said Petya, offended by Natasha�s first remark, �because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles� (so Petya described his namesake, the new Count Bezukhov); �now she�s in love with this singer� (Petya was referring to Natasha�s Italian singing teacher): �so she�s ashamed.�

�Petya, you�re stupid,� said Natasha.

�No stupider than you, old girl,� said the nine-year-old Petya, as if he was an old brigadier.

The countess had been prepared during dinner by Anna Mikhailovna�s hints. Going to her room, she sat in an armchair, not taking her eyes from the miniature portrait of her son on a snuffbox, and tears welled up in her eyes. Anna Mikhailovna came to the countess�s room on tiptoe with the letter and paused.

�Don�t come in,� she said to the old count, who was following her, �later,� she said, and closed the door behind her.

The count put his ear to the keyhole and began to listen.

At first he heard the sounds of indifferent talk, then only the sound of Anna Mikhailovna�s voice making a long speech, then a cry, then silence, then both voices again, speaking together with joyful intonations, and then footsteps, and then Anna Mikhailovna opened the door to him. Anna Mikhailovna�s face bore the proud expression of a surgeon who has completed a difficult amputation and admits the public so that it can appreciate his art.

�C�est fait!� she said to the count, pointing with a solemn gesture to the countess, who was holding the snuffbox with the portrait in one hand and the letter in the other, and pressing her lips first to the one, then to the other.

Seeing the count, she held her arms out to him, embraced his bald head, and again, over his bald head, looked at the letter and the portrait, and again pushed the bald head slightly away so as to press her lips to them. Vera, Natasha, Sonya, and Petya came into the room, and the reading began. In the letter Nikolushka gave a brief description of the march, the two battles in which he had taken part, and his promotion to officer, and said that he kissed the hands of maman and papa, asking their blessing, and kissed Vera, Natasha, and Petya. Besides that, he sent his greetings to M. Schelling, and Mme Schoss, and the nanny, and besides that he asked them to kiss his dear Sonya, whom he loved as ever and remembered as ever. Hearing that, Sonya blushed so much that tears came to her eyes. And, unable to bear the gazes turned to her, she rushed to the ballroom, made a run, twirled, and, her dress ballooning, all flushed and smiling, sat down on the floor. The countess was crying.

�What are you crying for, maman?� said Vera. �From all that he writes, you should rejoice and not cry.�

That was perfectly correct, but the count, and the countess, and Natasha�everyone looked at her with reproach. �Who does she take after?� thought the countess.

Nikolushka�s letter was read a hundred times, and those who were deemed worthy of listening to it had to come to the countess, who never let it out of her hands. Tutors, nannies, Mitenka, some acquaintances came, and the countess reread the letter each time with new delight and each time, through this letter, discovered new virtues in her Nikolushka. How strange, extraordinary, joyful it was that her son�that son who twenty years ago had moved his tiny limbs barely perceptibly inside her, that son over whom she had quarreled with the too-indulgent count, that son who had first learned to say �brush,� and then �mama,� that this son was now there, in a foreign land, in foreign surroundings, a manly warrior, alone, with no help or guidance, and doing there some manly business of his own. All the worldwide, age-old experience showing that children grow in an imperceptible way from the cradle to manhood, did not exist for the countess. Her son�s maturing had been at every point as extraordinary for her as if there had not been millions upon millions of men who had matured in just the same way. As it was hard to believe twenty years ago that the little being who lived somewhere under her heart would start crying, and suck her breast, and begin to talk, so now it was hard to believe that this same being could be the strong, brave man, an example to sons and people, that he was now, judging by this letter.

�What shtil, how nicely he describes things!� she said, reading the descriptive part of the letter. �And what soul! Nothing about himself�nothing! About some Denisov, but he himself is probably braver than all of them. He writes nothing about his sufferings. And what heart! It�s so like him! And how he remembered everyone! He didn�t forget anybody. I always, always said, when he was only so high, I always said��

For more than a week the whole house prepared, wrote drafts, and rewrote clean copies of letters to Nikolushka; under the countess�s supervision and the count�s solicitude the necessary things and money were gathered to outfit the newly promoted officer and provide for his needs. Anna Mikhailovna, a practical woman, had been able to arrange patronage for herself and her son in the army even for purposes of correspondence. She could send her letters to the grand duke Konstantin Pavlovich, who commanded the guards. The Rostovs assumed that the address Russian Guards Abroad was a perfectly definite address, and that, if the letter reached the grand duke who was in command of the guards, there was no reason to think it would not reach the Pavlogradsky regiment, which should be in the vicinity; and therefore it was decided to send the letters and money through the grand duke�s courier to Boris, and Boris would have to deliver them to Nikolushka. There were letters from the old count, from the countess, from Petya, from Vera, from Natasha, and from Sonya, and, finally, 6,000 roubles for outfitting, as well as various things the count sent to his son.


VII

On the twelfth of November, Kutuzov�s active army, camped near Olm&#252;tz, was preparing to be reviewed the next day by two emperors�Russian and Austrian. The guards, just arrived from Russia, were spending the night some ten miles from Olm&#252;tz, and the next day would come straight to the review, entering the field at Olm&#252;tz by ten o�clock in the morning.

Nikolai Rostov received a note from Boris that day, informing him that the Izmailovsky regiment was spending the night ten miles from Olm&#252;tz, and that Boris was waiting for him, so as to give him a letter and money. Rostov especially needed money now, since the troops, having returned from the campaign, were stationed near Olm&#252;tz, where well-stocked sutlers and Austrian Jews filled the camp, offering all sorts of temptations. The Pavlogradsky hussars had one feast after another, celebrating the rewards they had received for the campaign, and made trips to Olm&#252;tz to visit the newly arrived Karolina the Hungarian, who had opened a tavern there with female waiters. Rostov had recently celebrated his promotion to cornet, had bought Bedouin, Denisov�s horse, and was in debt all around to comrades and sutlers. On receiving Boris�s note, Rostov rode to Olm&#252;tz with a comrade, had dinner there, drank a bottle of wine, and rode on alone to the guards� camp to look for his childhood friend. Rostov had not yet had time to outfit himself. He was in a much-worn junker�s jacket with a soldier�s cross, the same sort of riding breeches with a shabby leather seat, and an officer�s saber with a sword knot; he was riding a Don horse that he had bought from a Cossack while on campaign; his crumpled hussar�s cap was dashingly pushed back and cocked. Riding up to the camp of the Izmailovsky regiment, he was thinking about how he would impress Boris and all his comrades in the guards by his look of a battle-seasoned hussar.

The guards had made the whole march as if on a promenade, showing off their cleanness and discipline. The stages were short, their packs were transported in wagons, the Austrian authorities prepared excellent dinners for the officers all along the way. The regiments entered and left towns to music, and for the whole march (something the guards took pride in), on the order of the grand duke, the men had walked in step, the officers on foot at their posts. All during the march, Boris had walked and quartered with Berg, who was now already a company commander. Berg, who had obtained the company during the march, had managed by his efficiency and neatness to earn the confidence of his superiors, and had arranged his financial affairs rather profitably; Boris had made many acquaintances during the march with people who could be useful to him, and, through a letter of recommendation brought to him from Pierre, had become acquainted with Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, through whom he hoped to get a post on the commander in chief�s staff. Berg and Boris, cleanly and neatly dressed, having rested after the day�s march, were sitting at a round table in the clean apartment assigned to them and playing checkers. Berg was holding a smoking little pipe between his knees. Boris, with his particular neatness, had piled the pieces in a pyramid with his slender white hands, waiting for Berg�s move and watching his partner�s face, obviously thinking about the game, as he always thought only about what he was engaged in.

�Well, how are you going to get out of that?� he said.

�We�ll try,� replied Berg, touching a piece and taking his hand away again.

Just then the door opened.

�Ah, here he is at last!� cried Rostov. �And Berg�s here, too! Ah, you petisenfan, allay cushay dormir!� he cried, repeating the words of their nanny, at whom he and Boris used to laugh together.

�Good heavens! how you�ve changed!� Boris rose to meet Rostov, but in rising did not forget to pick up the fallen chessmen and put them in place, and was about to embrace his friend, but Nikolai drew back from him. With that feeling peculiar to youth, which fears beaten paths and wants, not to imitate others, but to express its feelings in a new, personal way, only not in the often feigned way its elders do, Nikolai wanted to do something special on meeting his friend: he wanted somehow to pinch or push Boris, only not to kiss him as everybody does. Boris, on the contrary, calmly and amicably embraced Rostov and kissed him three times.

They had not seen each other for nearly half a year; and at their age, when young men take their first steps on life�s path, they both found enormous changes in each other, totally new reflections of the society in which they had taken their first steps in life. Both had changed greatly since their last meeting, and both wanted the sooner to show each other the changes that had taken place in them.

�Ah, you cursed floor-scrubbers! Clean, fresh, as if from a promenade, not like us sinful army folk,� Rostov said, with baritone sounds in his voice and an army manner that were new for Boris, pointing to his mud-splashed breeches.

The German landlady stuck her head through the door, hearing Rostov�s loud voice.

�A pretty little thing, eh?� he said, winking.

�Why are you shouting so? You�ll frighten them,� said Boris. �I wasn�t expecting you today,� he added. �I sent you a note just yesterday through an acquaintance, Kutuzov�s adjutant�Bolkonsky. I didn�t think he�d deliver it to you so soon�Well, how are you? Already been under fire?� asked Boris.

Rostov, without answering, shook the soldier�s Cross of St. George that hung on the cords of his uniform and, pointing to his arm in a sling, looked smiling at Berg.

�As you see,� he said.

�Well, there, yes, yes!� Boris said, smiling. �And we also had a nice march. You know, the grand duke constantly rode with our regiment, and so we had all the conveniences and advantages. The receptions we had in Poland, the dinners, the balls�I can�t tell you! And the grand duke was very gracious to all our officers.�

And the two friends began telling each other�the one about his hussar carousing and life at the front, the other about the pleasures and advantages of serving under the command of highly placed persons, and so on.

�Oh, you guards!� said Rostov. �But listen, send for some wine.�

Boris winced.

�If you�re sure you want it,� he said.

And going to his bed, he took a purse from under the clean pillows and ordered wine brought.

�Yes, and I have to give you your money and letter,� he added.

Rostov took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, leaned both elbows on the table and began to read. He read a few lines and glanced angrily at Berg. Having met his eyes, Rostov covered his face with the letter.

�They sent you a decent sum of money, though,� said Berg, looking at the heavy purse pressing down on the sofa. �And we just get by on our pay, Count. I�ll tell you about myself��

�The thing is this, Berg, my dear,� said Rostov. �If you received a letter from home and met one of your people, whom you�d like to question about everything, and I happened to be there�I�d leave at once, so as not to interfere with you. Listen, please go away, somewhere, anywhere�to the devil!� he cried, and taking him by the shoulder at once and looking amiably into his face, obviously trying to soften the rudeness of his words, he added: �You know, don�t be angry, my dear, kind fellow, I�m speaking from the heart, as to our old acquaintance.�

�Ah, for pity�s sake, Count, I understand very well,� said Berg, getting up and speaking to himelf in a guttural voice.

�Go across to the landlords: they invited you,� added Boris.

Berg put on the cleanest of frock coats, with not a spot or speck on it, fluffed up his whiskers in front of the mirror, as Alexander Pavlovich wore them, and, assuring himself from Rostov�s glance that his frock coat had been noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.

�Ah, what a beast I am, though!� said Rostov, reading the letter.

�What�s wrong?�

�Ah, what a swine I am, though, that I didn�t write even once and frightened them so. Ah, what a swine I am!� he repeated, suddenly blushing. �So send Gavrilo for wine! Let�s have a drink!� he said.

Among the letters from his family there was also a letter of recommendation to Prince Bagration, which the old countess had obtained through acquaintances, on the advice of Anna Mikhailovna, and sent on to her son, asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it.

�What stupidity! As if I need it,� said Rostov, throwing the letter under the table.

�Why did you throw it on the floor?� asked Boris.

�It�s some sort of letter of recommendation, what the devil is a letter to me!�

�How do you mean, what the devil is a letter?� said Boris, picking it up and reading the address. �You need this letter very much.�

�I don�t need anything, and I won�t go and be anybody�s adjutant.�

�Why not?� asked Boris.

�It�s a lackey�s job.�

�You�re still the same dreamer, I see,� said Boris, shaking his head.

�And you�re the same diplomat. Well, but that�s not the point�Well, how are you?� asked Rostov.

�As you see. So far everything�s fine; but I confess, my wish, and it�s a great one, is to become an adjutant and not stay at the front.�

�Why?�

�Because once you�ve set out on a career in military service, you should try to do all you can to make it a brilliant career.�

�Ah, so that�s it!� said Rostov, evidently thinking about something else.

He looked intently and questioningly into his friend�s eyes, evidently searching in vain for the answer to some question.

Old Gavrilo brought the wine.

�Shouldn�t we send for Alphonse Karlych now?� asked Boris. �He�ll drink with you. I can�t.�

�Send for him, send for him! Well, and what�s this German like?� Rostov asked with a scornful smile.

�He�s a very good, honest, and agreeable man,� said Boris.

Rostov once again looked intently into Boris�s eyes and sighed. Berg returned, and over a bottle of wine the conversation of these three officers became animated. The two guardsmen told Rostov about their march, about how they were honored in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They told about the words and deeds of their commander, the grand duke, anecdotes about his kindness and hot temper. Berg, as usual, kept silent when things did not concern him personally, but on the occasion of anecdotes about the grand duke�s hot temper, he told with delight how in Galicia he had managed to talk with the grand duke, when he was making the rounds of the regiments and waxed wroth at the incorrectness of a maneuver. With a pleasant smile on his face, he told how the grand duke, in great wrath, had ridden up to him and shouted: �Arnauti!� (Arnauti was his highness�s favorite word when he was wrathful), and summoned the regimental commander.

�Would you believe it, Count, I wasn�t afraid at all, because I knew I was right. You know, Count, I can say without boasting that I know the regimental orders by heart, and I also know the regulations like the Our Father in Heaven. That�s why there�s no negligence in my company, Count. So my conscience was at ease. I presented myself.� (Berg stood up and impersonated how he had presented himself with his hand to his visor. Indeed, it would be hard to impersonate any greater deference and self-satisfaction.) �He roasted me, as they say, roasted, roasted; roasted me not to the quick, but to death, as they say: �Arnauti,� and �devils,� and �to Siberia,�� Berg said, smiling shrewdly. �I know I�m right, so I say nothing, isn�t that the way, Count? �Are you mute, or what?� he shouts. I still say nothing. And what do you think, Count? The next day there was nothing in the orders; that�s what it means not to get flustered! There you are, Count,� said Berg, lighting his pipe and letting out little smoke rings.

�Yes, very nice,� said Rostov, smiling.

But Boris, noticing that Rostov was preparing to make fun of Berg, artfully diverted the conversation. He asked Rostov to tell them how and where he had received his wound. This pleased Rostov, and he began telling the story, growing more and more animated as it went on. He told them about his Sch&#246;ngraben action in just the way that those who take part in battles usually tell about them, that is, in the way they would like it to have been, the way they have heard others tell it, the way it could be told more beautifully, but not at all the way it had been. Rostov was a truthful young man, not for anything would he have deliberately told an untruth. He began telling the story with the intention of telling it exactly as it had been, but imperceptibly, involuntarily, and inevitably for himself, he went over into untruth. If he had told the truth to these listeners, who, like himself, had already heard accounts of attacks numerous times and had formed for themselves a definite notion of what an attack was, and were expecting exactly the same sort of account�they either would not have believed him or, worse still, would have thought it was Rostov�s own fault that what usually happens in stories of cavalry attacks had not happened with him. He could not simply tell them that they all set out at a trot, he fell off his horse, dislocated his arm, and ran to the woods as fast as he could to escape a Frenchman. Besides, in order to tell everything as it had been, one would have to make an effort with oneself so as to tell only what had been. To tell the truth is very difficult, and young men are rarely capable of it. They were expecting an account of how he got all fired up, forgetting himself, how he flew like a storm at the square; how he cut his way into it, hacking right and left; how his saber tasted flesh, how he fell exhausted, and so on. And he told them all that.

In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: �You can�t imagine what a strange feeling of fury one experiences during an attack,� Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, whom Boris was expecting, came in. Prince Andrei, who liked to patronize young men, who was flattered to be turned to for a favor, and was well-disposed towards Boris, who had managed to please him the day before, wished to fulfill the young man�s wish. Sent by Kutuzov with papers for the grand duke, he stopped to see the young man, hoping to find him alone. Coming into the room and seeing a frontline hussar telling about his military adventures (the sort of people Prince Andrei could not stand), he smiled affectionately to Boris, winced, narrowed his eyes at Rostov, and, bowing slightly, sat down wearily and lazily on the sofa. He was not pleased to have landed among bad company. Rostov blushed, understanding that. But it was all the same to him: the man was an outsider. But, glancing at Boris, he saw that he, too, seemed ashamed of the frontline hussar. In spite of Prince Andrei�s unpleasant, mocking tone, in spite of the general disdain which Rostov, from his fighting army point of view, had for all these staff adjutants, to whom the newcomer obviously belonged, Rostov felt embarrassed, turned red, and fell silent. Boris asked what was the news at the staff and what, without being indiscreet, was rumored about our dispositions.

�They�ll probably advance,� Bolkonsky replied, clearly not wishing to say more in front of strangers.

Berg used the opportunity to ask with particular courtesy whether, as rumor had it, company commanders were now to draw a double allotment for forage. To which Prince Andrei replied with a smile that he was unable to opine about such important government instructions, and Berg laughed joyfully.

�About your affair,� Prince Andrei turned to Boris again, �we�ll speak later,� and he glanced at Rostov. �Come to me after the review, we�ll do all that�s possible.�

And, glancing around the room, he turned to Rostov, whose state of uncontrollable childish embarrassment, turning into spite, he did not deign to notice, and said:

�It seems you were telling about the Sch&#246;ngraben action? Were you there?�

�I was there,� Rostov said spitefully, as if wishing to insult the adjutant by it.

Bolkonsky noticed the hussar�s state and found it amusing. He gave a slightly contemptuous smile.

�Yes! many stories are told now about that action.�

�Yes, stories!� Rostov began speaking loudly, glancing now at Boris, now at Bolkonsky, with eyes suddenly grown furious. �Yes, many stories are told, but our stories�the stories of those who were there, right under enemy fire�our stories have weight, not the stories of those fellows on the staff, who get rewards for doing nothing.�

�To whom you suppose that I belong?� Prince Andrei said calmly and with an especially pleasant smile.

A strange feeling of spite and along with that of respect for the calmness of this figure came together at that moment in Rostov�s soul.

�I�m not talking about you,� he said, �I don�t know you, and, I confess, I don�t wish to. I�m talking about the staff in general.�

�And I will tell you this,� Prince Andrei interrupted him with calm power in his voice. �You want to insult me, and I am ready to agree with you that it is very easy to do so, if you lack sufficient respect for yourself; but you must agree that the time and place have been rather poorly chosen for that. One of these days we�ll all take part in a big, more serious duel, and besides that, Drubetskoy, who says he�s your old friend, is not at all to blame for the fact that my physiognomy has the misfortune not to please you. However,� he said, getting up, �you know my name and where to find me; but don�t forget,� he added, �that I consider neither myself nor you insulted in the least, and my advice, as an older man, is to let this matter go without consequences. So I�ll be waiting for you on Friday after the review, Drubetskoy. Good-bye,� Prince Andrei concluded and left, after bowing to them both.

Rostov remembered what reply he should have given only when the man was already gone. And he was the more angry because he had forgotten to say it. Rostov ordered his horse brought at once, and having drily taken leave of Boris, rode home. Should he go to headquarters tomorrow and challenge this mincing adjutant, or indeed let the affair go at that? This was the question that tormented him all the way. Now he thought spitefully of what a pleasure it would be to see this small, weak, and proud man�s fear in the face of his pistol, then he was surprised to feel that, of all the people he knew, there was no one he so wished to have for a friend as this hateful little adjutant.


VIII

On the day after the meeting of Boris and Rostov, there was a review of the Russian and Austrian troops, the fresh ones come from Russia, as well as those returned from campaigning with Kutuzov. Both emperors, the Russian with his heir the grand duke, and the Austrian with the archduke, made this review of the combined eighty-thousand-man army.

Since early morning, the trim and smartly polished troops had been on the move, lining up in the field in front of the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets moved with flying standards and, at the officers� command, halted, turned, and lined up at intervals, circling around other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms; now there came the sounds of the measured thudding and clanking of the dressed-up cavalry, in blue, red, and green embroidered uniforms, with embroidered musicians in front, on black, chestnut, or gray horses; now, stretching out with the brazen noise of polished, shining cannon shaking on their carriages, and with their smell of linstocks, the artillery crawled between the infantry and cavalry and settled in their appointed places. Not only the generals in full parade dress, their waists, fat or slender, tightened to the utmost, their necks reddened by high-propped collars, wearing sashes and all their decorations; not only the pomaded, spruced-up officers, but every soldier, his face freshly scrubbed and shaven, his equipment polished to the highest shine possible, and every horse, groomed so that its hide gleamed like satin, its wetted mane lying hair by hair�they all felt that what was taking place was earnest, significant, and solemn. Every general and soldier sensed his own nullity, aware of being a grain of sand in this sea of people, and at the same time sensed his strength, aware of being part of this enormous whole.

From early morning strenuous bustling and efforts had begun, and by ten o�clock everything had reached the required order. The ranks were drawn up on the enormous field. The entire army was stretched out in three lines. In the front, the cavalry; behind them, the artillery; further behind, the infantry.

Between each kind of troops was a sort of street. The three parts of this army could be clearly distinguished from each other: Kutuzov�s fighting force (in which the Pavlogradsky regiment stood on the right flank in the front line), the infantry and guards regiments come from Russia, and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in one line, under one command, and in the same order.

Like wind in the leaves, an excited whisper passed: �They�re coming! they�re coming!� Frightened voices were heard, and the bustle of final preparations rippled through the troops.

Before them, coming from Olm&#252;tz, a moving group appeared. And at the same time, though it was a windless day, a light current of wind ran through the army and barely stirred the lance pennants and slack standards, which began to flutter against their staffs. It seemed the army itself, by this slight movement, was expressing its joy at the approaching sovereigns. A single voice was heard: �Attention!� Then, like cocks at dawn, voices repeated it from all ends. And everything became still.

In the deathly silence only the thud of hooves could be heard. This was the emperors� suite. The sovereigns rode up to the flanks, and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment rang out, playing the general march. It seemed it was not the trumpeters playing, but the army itself, rejoicing at the sovereigns� approach, that naturally produced these sounds. Through these sounds the one young, gentle voice of the emperor Alexander was distinctly heard. He uttered a greeting, and the first regiment bawled out such a deafening, prolonged, and joyful �Hurrah!� that the men themselves were awestruck at the multitude and strength of the huge bulk they made up.

Rostov, standing in the front ranks of Kutuzov�s army, which the sovereign rode up to first, had the same feeling that was experienced by every man in that army�a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud awareness of strength, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this solemnity.

He felt that it would take only one word from this man for that whole mass (and he himself bound up with it�an insignificant speck) to go through fire and water, to crime, to death, or to the greatest heroism, and therefore he could not but tremble and thrill at the sight of that approaching word.

�Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!� thundered on all sides, and one regiment after another received the sovereign to the strains of the general march; then �Hurrah!� and the general march, and again �Hurrah!� and �Hurrah!��which, ever growing and swelling, merged into a deafening roar.

Before the approach of the sovereign, each regiment, in its speechlessness and immobility, seemed a lifeless body; but as soon as the sovereign drew level with it, the regiment came alive and thundered, joining the roar of the entire line which the sovereign had already passed. To the terrible, deafening sound of these voices, amidst the masses of troops, motionless, as if petrified in their rectangles, the hundreds of horsemen of the suite moved casually, asymmetrically, and, above all, freely, and in front of them two men�the emperors. Upon them was concentrated the restrainedly passionate, undivided attention of this entire mass of men.

The handsome young emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the horse guards, in a triangular hat, worn brim first, with his pleasant face and sonorous but not loud voice, attracted the full force of attention.

Rostov stood not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen-sighted eyes he recognized the sovereign from afar and followed his approach. When the sovereign had approached to within twenty paces, and Nikolai could make out clearly, in all its details, the handsome, young, and happy face of the emperor, he experienced a feeling of tenderness and rapture such as he had never experienced before. Every feature, every movement of the sovereign seemed lovely to him.

Having stopped facing the Pavlogradsky regiment, the sovereign said something in French to the Austrian emperor and smiled.

Seeing that smile, Rostov involuntarily began to smile himself and felt a still stronger surge of love for his sovereign. He wanted to show his love for the sovereign in some way. He knew that this was impossible and wanted to cry. The sovereign summoned the regimental commander and said a few words to him.

�My God! what would happen to me if the sovereign addressed me!� thought Rostov. �I�d die of happiness.�

The sovereign also addressed the officers.

�I thank you all, gentlemen� (every word Rostov heard was like a sound from heaven), �with all my heart.�

How happy Rostov would be if he could die now for his sovereign!

�You have merited the St. George standards and will be worthy of them.�

�Just to die, to die for him!� thought Rostov.

The sovereign said something more which Rostov did not hear, and the soldiers, straining their chests, shouted: �Hurrah!�

Rostov also shouted with all his might, leaning towards his saddle, wishing to hurt himself with this cry, only so as to express fully his rapture for the sovereign.

The sovereign stood for a few seconds facing the hussars, as if undecided.

�How can a sovereign be undecided?� thought Rostov, and then even this indecision seemed majestic and enchanting to Rostov, like everything the sovereign did.

The sovereign�s indecision lasted only a moment. The sovereign�s foot, in the narrow, sharp toe of its boot, as they wore them then, touched the belly of the bobtailed bay mare he was riding; the sovereign�s hand in its white glove picked up the reins, and he set off, accompanied by a disorderly swaying sea of adjutants. He rode further and further, stopping by other regiments, and at last Rostov could only see his white plumes beyond the suite that surrounded the emperors.

Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rostov noticed Bolkonsky, sitting his horse lazily and casually. Rostov remembered his quarrel with him yesterday, and the question arose whether he should or should not challenge him. �Of course not,� Rostov thought now��And is it worth thinking and talking about it at a moment like this? At a moment of such a feeling of love, rapture, and self-denial�what are all our quarrels and offenses?! I love everybody, I forgive everybody now,� thought Rostov.

When the sovereign had ridden by almost all the regiments, the troops began a ceremonial march past him, and Rostov, on Bedouin, newly purchased from Denisov, rode at the tail end of his squadron�that is, alone and in full view of the sovereign.

Before he reached the sovereign, Rostov, an excellent horseman, twice put the spurs to his Bedouin and happily brought him to that furious-paced trot which Bedouin was prone to when excited. Lowering his foaming muzzle to his chest, his tail extended, and as if flying through the air without touching the ground, gracefully lifting his legs high as he shifted them, Bedouin, who also felt the sovereign�s gaze upon him, passed by superbly.

Rostov himself, flinging his legs back, drawing his stomach in, and feeling himself one piece with his horse, with a frowning but blissful face, like the �very devil,� as Denisov used to say, rode past the sovereign.

�Bravo, Pavlogradskies!� said the sovereign.

�My God! How happy I�d be if he ordered me right now to throw myself into the fire,� thought Rostov.

When the review was over, the officers, both the newly arrived and Kutuzov�s, began to gather in groups, and talk sprang up about rewards, about the Austrians and their uniforms, about their front, about Bonaparte and how bad things were going to be for him now, especially when the corps from Essen also arrives and Prussia takes our side.

But most of all, in all circles, they talked about the sovereign Alexander, repeating his every word and movement and admiring him.

They all wished for only one thing: to go quickly against the enemy under the sovereign�s leadership. Under the command of the sovereign himself, it would be impossible not to defeat anyone whatever�so thought Rostov and most of the officers.

After the review, there was greater assurance of victory than there might have been after two victorious battles.



IX

The day after the review, Boris, putting on his best uniform and with parting wishes of success from his comrade Berg, rode to see Bolkonsky in Olm&#252;tz, wishing to avail himself of his friendliness and arrange the best position for himself, in particular the position of adjutant to an important person, which seemed to him particularly attractive in the army. �It�s all right for Rostov, whose father sends him ten thousand roubles at a time, to talk about how he doesn�t want to bow to anybody or be anybody�s lackey; but I, who have nothing except my own head, must make my career and not let chances slip, but avail myself of them.�

He did not find Prince Andrei in Olm&#252;tz that day. But the sight of Olm&#252;tz, where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and both emperors lived with their suites of courtiers and attendants, increased still more his desire to belong to that supreme world.

He knew nobody, and, despite his dashing guardsman�s uniform, all these higher people going up and down the streets in dashing carriages, plumes, ribbons and decorations, courtiers and military, seemed to stand so immeasurably higher than he, a little officer of the guards, that they not only did not want to, but even could not recognize his existence. In the quarters of the commander in chief Kutuzov, where he asked for Bolkonsky, all these adjutants and even orderlies looked at him as if wishing to impress upon him that quite a few officers such as he hung around there, and that they were all quite sick of it. Despite that, or rather, because of it, the next day, the fifteenth, after dinner he went to Olm&#252;tz again, and, going into the house occupied by Kutuzov, asked for Bolkonsky. Prince Andrei was at home, and Boris was taken to a large hall, which probably had once been used for dancing, and now was filled with five beds and various furnishings: tables, chairs, and a pianoforte. One adjutant, closer to the door, in a Persian dressing gown, was sitting at a table and writing. A second, the red, fat Nesvitsky, was lying on a bed with his hands behind his head and laughing along with another officer who was sitting with him. A third was playing a Viennese waltz on the pianoforte, a fourth was lying on the pianoforte and singing along. Bolkonsky was not there. None of these gentlemen changed his position on noticing Boris. The one who was writing and whom Boris addressed, turned to him vexedly and told him that Bolkonsky was on duty, and that if he wanted to see him, he should go through the door on the left, to the reception room. Boris thanked him and went into the reception room. In the reception room there were some ten officers and generals.

Just as Boris came in, Prince Andrei, narrowing his eyes disdainfully (with that particular air of polite weariness which says clearly that, were it not my duty, I would not talk with you for a minute), was listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who, drawn up almost on tiptoe, with an obsequious soldierly expression on his purple face, was reporting something to him.

�Very well, be so good as to wait,� he said to the general in Russian, with that French pronunciation which he used when he wanted to speak disdainfully, and, noticing Boris and no longer addressing the general (who pleadingly ran after him asking to be heard out), Prince Andrei turned to Boris with a cheerful smile, nodding to him.

Boris clearly understood at that moment what he had foreseen earlier, namely, that in the army, besides the subordination and discipline that were written in the regulations and known to the regiment, and which he knew, there was another more essential subordination, which made this tightly girded, purple-faced general wait deferentially while the captain Prince Andrei, for his own pleasure, found it preferable to talk with the ensign Drubetskoy. Boris resolved more than ever to serve in the future according to this unwritten subordination, not the one written in the regulations. He now felt that, merely as the result of his having been recommended to Prince Andrei, he had at once become higher than the general, who, on other occasions, at the front, could annihilate an ensign of the guards like him. Prince Andrei went up to him and took his hand.

�Very sorry you didn�t find me in yesterday. I spent the whole day fussing about with the Germans. Went to see Weyrother to check the disposition. When Germans start being accurate, there�s no end to it!�

Boris smiled as if he understood what Prince Andrei was hinting at as common knowledge. But it was the first time he had heard the name of Weyrother and even the word disposition.

�Well, what is it, my friend, do you still want to be an adjutant? I�ve been thinking about you meanwhile.�

�Yes,� said Boris, blushing involuntarily for some reason, �I thought of asking the commander in chief; he received a letter about me from Prince Kuragin; I wanted to ask,� he added, as if apologizing, �because I�m afraid the guards won�t see action.�

�Very good, very good! We�ll discuss it all,� said Prince Andrei. �Just let me report about this gentleman, and then I�m yours.�

While Prince Andrei went to report about the purple general, that general, who obviously did not share Boris�s notions about the advantages of the unwritten subordination, so fixed his eyes on the insolent ensign who had prevented him from finishing his talk with the adjutant that Boris felt awkward. He turned away and waited impatiently for Prince Andrei to come back from the commander in chief�s office.

�You see, my friend, I�ve been thinking about you,� said Prince Andrei, when they came to the big room with the pianoforte. �There�s no point in your going to the commander in chief,� said Prince Andrei. �He�ll tell you a heap of nice things, ask you to dinner� (�That wouldn�t be so bad for service by the other subordination,� thought Boris), �but nothing further will come of it. There will soon be a battalion of us adjutants and orderly officers. But here�s what we�ll do: I have a good friend, an adjutant general and a wonderful man, Prince Dolgorukov; and though you couldn�t know this, the thing is that Kutuzov and his staff and all of us mean precisely nothing: everything is now concentrated on the sovereign. So let�s go to Dolgorukov, I have to go to him anyway, and I�ve already spoken to him about you; so we�ll see whether he can�t find it possible to set you up with him or somewhere else closer to the sun.�

Prince Andrei always became especially animated when he had to guide a young man and help him towards worldly success. Under the pretext of this help for another, which out of pride he would never accept for himself, he found himself close to the milieu which conferred success and which attracted him. He took up Boris quite willingly and went with him to Prince Dolgorukov.

It was already late in the evening when they entered the Olm&#252;tz palace, which was occupied by the emperors and their retinues.

On that same day there had been a council of war in which all the members of the Hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part. At the council, in opposition to the opinion of the old men�Kutuzov and Prince Schwarzenberg�it was decided to go on the offensive immediately and give general battle to Bonaparte. The council of war had just ended when Prince Andrei, accompanied by Boris, came to the palace to look for Prince Dolgorukov. The headquarters personnel were all still under the charm of that day�s council of war, which had been victorious for the younger party. The voices of the foot-draggers, who advised waiting for something else and not going on the offensive, had been so unanimously stifled and their arguments refuted by the indubitable proofs of the advantages of an offensive, that what was talked about at the council�the future battle and undoubted victory�seemed no longer future but past. All the advantages were on our side. Enormous forces, undoubtedly superior to Napoleon�s, were massed in one place; the troops were inspired by the presence of the emperors and straining for action; the strategic point at which they were to act was known in the smallest detail to the Austrian general Weyrother, who was leading the army (as if by a lucky chance, the Austrian troops had been on maneuvers a year before precisely on the fields where they were now to fight the French); the lay of the land was known and mapped in the smallest detail; and Bonaparte, obviously weakened, was undertaking nothing.

Dolgorukov, one of the most fervent advocates of the offensive, had just come back from the council, weary, exhausted, but animated and proud of the victory won. Prince Andrei introduced the officer he was patronizing, but Prince Dolgorukov, giving him a polite and firm handshake, said nothing to Boris and, obviously unable to keep from speaking out the thoughts that occupied him most at that moment, addressed Prince Andrei in French.

�Well, my friend, what a battle we went through! God only grant that the one that results from it is as victorious. However, my dear,� he spoke haltingly and animatedly, �I must confess my guilt before the Austrians and especially before Weyrother. What precision, what detail, what knowledge of the terrain, what foresight of all possibilities, all conditions, all the smallest details! No, my dear, more advantageous conditions than those we find ourselves in could not be purposely invented. The combination of Austrian clarity with Russian courage�what more do you want?�

�So the offensive is definitely decided upon?� asked Bolkonsky.

�And you know, my friend, it seems to me that Bonaparte has decidedly lost his Latin. You know, a letter to the emperor came from him today.� Dolgorukov smiled significantly.

�Well, now! What does he write?� asked Bolkonsky.

�What can he write? Fal-di-diddle-da and the like, all only with the purpose of gaining time. I tell you, he�s in our hands, that�s certain. But the most amusing thing,� he said, suddenly laughing good-naturedly, �is that we simply couldn�t decide how to address the reply! If not as consul, and naturally not as emperor, then as General Buonaparte, it seemed to me.�

�But there�s a difference between not acknowledging him as emperor and calling him General Buonaparte,� said Bolkonsky.

�That�s just it,� Dolgorukov interrupted, laughing and speaking quickly. �You know Bilibin, he�s a very intelligent man, he suggested addressing him as �Usurper and Enemy of the Human Race.��

Dolgorukov burst into merry laughter.

�No more than that?� remarked Bolkonsky.

�But anyhow Bilibin found a serious title of address. A witty and intelligent man��

�What is it?�

��To the head of the French Government, Au chef du gouvernement fran&#231;ais,�� Dolgorukov said seriously and with satisfaction. �It�s good, isn�t it?�

�It�s good, but he�ll dislike it very much,� remarked Bolkonsky.

�Oh, very much! My brother knows him: he dined with him, the present emperor, more than once in Paris, and he told me that he never saw a more subtle and clever diplomat�you know, a combination of French adroitness and Italian playacting. Do you know the anecdotes about him and Count Mark&#243;v? Count Mark&#243;v was the only one who knew how to handle him. Do you know the story of the handkerchief? It�s charming!�

And the loquacious Dolgorukov, turning now to Boris, now to Prince Andrei, told how Bonaparte, wishing to test Mark&#243;v, our ambassador, purposely dropped his handkerchief in front of him and stood there looking at him, probably expecting a service from Mark&#243;v, and how Mark&#243;v at once dropped his own handkerchief next to it and picked it up, without picking up Bonaparte�s handkerchief.

�Charmant,� said Bolkonsky. �But the thing is, Prince, that I�ve come to solicit you for this young man. You see��

But before Prince Andrei finished, an adjutant came into the room to summon Prince Dolgorukov to the emperor.

�Ah, how vexing!� said Dolgorukov, hurriedly getting up and shaking hands with Prince Andrei and Boris. �You know, I�ll be very glad to do everything in my power both for you and for this nice young man.� He shook Boris�s hand once more with an expression of good-natured, sincere, and animated light-mindedness. �But you see�till next time!�

Boris was excited by the thought of the closeness to supreme power in which he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious of himself being in touch with the springs that controlled all those huge mass movements, of which he, in his regiment, felt himself a small, submissive, and insignificant part. They followed Prince Dolgorukov to the corridor and met, coming out of the door to the sovereign�s room by which Dolgorukov went in, a short man in civilian clothes, with an intelligent face and a distinctive, sharply protruding jaw, which, without spoiling his looks, endowed him with a particular liveliness and shiftiness of expression. This short man gave the nod of a close acquaintance to Dolgorukov, and began peering at Prince Andrei with an intently cold gaze, walking straight at him, and clearly expecting Prince Andrei to greet him or give way to him. Prince Andrei did neither; his face expressed spite, and the young man, turning away, went down the side of the corridor.

�Who�s that?� asked Boris.

�That is one of the most remarkable, and for me most unpleasant, of men. That is the minister of foreign affairs, Prince Adam Czartoryski. It�s these people,� Bolkonsky said with a sigh which he could not suppress, as they were leaving the palace, �it�s these people who decide the fates of nations.�

The next day the troops set out on the march, and Boris had no time up to the battle of Austerlitz itself to visit either Bolkonsky or Dolgorukov and remained for a time with the Izmailovsky regiment.


X

At dawn on the sixteenth, Denisov�s squadron, in which Nikolai Rostov served and which was in Bagration�s detachment, moved from its night lodgings into action, as they said, and having gone about half a mile behind other columns, halted on the high road. Rostov saw the Cossacks go past him, the first and second squadrons of hussars, the infantry battalions with the artillery, and then Generals Bagration and Dolgorukov rode past with their adjutants. All the fear which, as previously, he experienced before action, all the inner struggle by means of which he overcame that fear, all his dreams of how he would distinguish himself as a fine hussar in this action�went for naught. Their squadron was kept in reserve, and Nikolai Rostov spent that day feeling bored and melancholy. Between eight and nine in the morning, he heard gunfire ahead of him, shouts of �Hurrah,� saw some wounded brought back (they were not many), and finally saw a whole detachment of French cavalry led along in the midst of a Cossack hundred. Obviously the action was over, and the action had obviously been not big, but successful. The soldiers and officers coming back told of a brilliant victory, of the taking of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French squadron. The day was clear, sunny, after a heavy night frost, and the cheerful brightness of the fall day coincided with the news of the victory, which was reported not only by those who took part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of the soldiers, officers, generals, and adjutants who went there and came back past Rostov. The more wrung was Rostov�s heart, who had uselessly suffered all the fear that precedes a battle, and had spent this cheerful day in inaction.

�Rostov, come here, let�s drink from rief!� shouted Denisov, sitting down by the edge of the road in front of a flask and some food.

The officers gathered in a circle, eating and talking, around Denisov�s mess kit.

�Here they come with another one!� said one of the officers, pointing to a captured French dragoon whom two Cossacks were leading along on foot.

One of them was leading by the bridle the captive�s tall and beautiful French horse.

�Sell me the horse!� Denisov shouted to the Cossack.

�If you like, Your Honor��

The officers stood up and surrounded the Cossacks and the captured Frenchman. The French dragoon was a young fellow, an Alsatian, who spoke French with a German accent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and, hearing some words of French, he began speaking quickly to the officers, addressing now one, now another. He said that he would not have been taken, that it was not his fault that he was taken, but that of le caporal who had sent him to fetch the horse-cloths, that he had told him the Russians were already there. And to everything he said, he added: �mais qu�on ne fasse pas de mal &#224; mon petit cheval,� and caressed his horse. It was clear that he did not quite understand where he was. He now apologized for being taken, now, supposing he was facing his superiors, displayed his soldierly punctiliousness and zeal for service. He brought with him to our rear guard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French troops, which was so foreign to us.

The Cossacks let the horse go for two gold pieces, and Rostov, who now, having received money, was the richest of the officers, bought it.

�Mais qu�on ne fasse pas de mal &#224; mon petit cheval,� the Alsatian said good-naturedly to Rostov, when the horse was handed over to the hussar.

Rostov, smiling, reassured the dragoon and gave him some money.

�Allee, allee!� said the Cossack, touching the prisoner�s arm to urge him on.

�The sovereign! The sovereign!� was suddenly heard among the hussars.

Everyone began running, hurrying, and Rostov saw behind him on the road several horsemen with white plumes in their hats riding up. In a single moment, everyone was in his place and waiting.

Rostov did not remember and did not feel how he ran to his place and mounted his horse. His regret over his non-participation in the action, his humdrum mood in the circle of usual faces, instantly went away, and all thought of himself instantly vanished: he was wholly consumed by the feeling of happiness that came from the nearness of the sovereign. He felt himself rewarded by this nearness alone for the loss of that day. He was as happy as a lover who has obtained a hoped-for rendezvous. Not daring to turn to look while in line, and not looking, his rapturous senses felt his approach. And he felt it not only from the hoofbeats of the approaching cavalcade, but felt it because as it approached everything around him became brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more festive. This sun moved ever nearer and nearer to Rostov, spreading around itself rays of mild and majestic light, and he already feels himself caught up in those rays, he hears his voice�that gentle, calm, majestic, and at the same time so simple voice. As it had to be, according to Rostov�s feeling, a deathly silence ensued, and in that silence the sounds of the sovereign�s voice rang out.

�Les hussards de Pavlograd?� he said questioningly.

�La r&#233;serve, sire!� someone�s voice replied, so human after the non-human voice that had said: �Les hussards de Pavlograd?�

The sovereign drew even with Rostov and stopped. Alexander�s face was still more beautiful than three days before at the review. It shone with such cheer and youth, such innocent youth that it reminded one of a boyish fourteen-year-old friskiness, and at the same time it was still the face of a majestic emperor. Looking the squadron over at random, the sovereign�s eyes met the eyes of Rostov and rested on them for no more than two seconds. The sovereign may or may not have understood everything that was going on in Rostov�s soul (it seemed to Rostov that he had understood everything), but for about two seconds he looked with his pale blue eyes into Rostov�s face. (A soft, mild light poured from them.) Then he suddenly raised his eyebrows, spurred his horse with a sharp movement of his left foot, and rode on at a gallop.

On hearing gunfire in the vanguard, the young emperor could not restrain his desire to be present at the battle, and, despite all the remonstrations of his courtiers, at noon, having separated from the third column with which he was proceeding, he rode to the vanguard. Before he reached the hussars, several adjutants met him with news of the successful outcome of the action.

The battle, which consisted merely in the capture of a French squadron, was presented as a brilliant victory over the French, and therefore the sovereign and the whole army, especially while the powder smoke still hung over the battlefield, believed that the French were defeated and were retreating against their will. A few minutes after the sovereign rode by, the Pavlogradsky division was ordered to advance. In Wischau itself, a small German town, Rostov saw the sovereign once more. On the town square, where a rather intense exchange of gunfire had taken place before the sovereign�s arrival, lay several dead and wounded men, whom there had been no time to pick up. The sovereign, surrounded by his suite of military and non-military men, was on a bobtailed chestnut mare, already different from the one at the review, and, leaning to one side, holding a gold lorgnette to his eyes with a graceful gesture, was looking through it at a soldier who lay facedown, without his shako, his head bloody. The wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and vile that Rostov was offended by his nearness to the sovereign. Rostov saw how the sovereign�s stooping shoulders shuddered as if a chill ran through them, and how his left foot convulsively began to spur the horse�s side. The well-trained horse looked about indifferently and did not stir from its place. Getting off their horses, some adjutants took the soldier under the arms and began laying him on a stretcher which had just appeared. The soldier groaned.

�Gently, gently, can�t you do it gently?� said the sovereign, clearly suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode off.

Rostov saw the tears that filled the sovereign�s eyes, and heard him say in French to Czartoryski, as he rode off:

�What a terrible thing war is, what a terrible thing! Quel terrible chose que la guerre!�

The troops of the vanguard were positioned before Wischau within sight of the enemy line, which yielded ground to us throughout the day at the least exchange of fire. The sovereign�s gratitude was announced to the vanguard, with a promise of rewards, and the men were given a double ration of vodka. The bivouac fires crackled and the soldiers� songs rang out still more merrily than the previous night. Denisov celebrated his promotion to major that night, and Rostov, who had already drunk quite a bit, proposed a toast at the end of the party to the health of the sovereign, �but not of the sovereign emperor, as they say at official dinners,� he said, �but to the health of the sovereign, that kind, enchanting, and great man. We drink to his health and to certain victory over the French!�

�If we fought before,� he said, �and gave no quarter to the French, as at Sch&#246;ngraben, how will it be now when he himself is at our head? We�ll all die, we�ll gladly die for him. Right, gentlemen? Maybe I�m not speaking well, I�ve drunk a lot; but that�s how I feel, and so do you. To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!�

�Hurrah!� rang out the enthusiastic voices of the officers.

And old Captain Kirsten shouted enthusiastically and no less sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rostov.

When the officers drank up and smashed their glasses, Kirsten filled others, and, in nothing but his shirt and breeches, with the glass in his hand, went up to the soldiers� campfires, struck a majestic pose, with his long gray mustache, his white chest showing through his unbuttoned shirt, stood in the firelight, and swung his arm up.

�Lads, to the health of the sovereign emperor, to victory over our foes, hurrah!� he cried in his dashing old hussar�s baritone.

The hussars clustered around him and responded all together in a loud shout.

Late that night, when everyone had dispersed, Denisov, with his short hand, patted his favorite, Rostov, on the shoulder.

�There�s nobody to fall in love with on campaign, so he�s fallen in love with the tsar,� he said.

�Don�t joke about that, Denisov,� cried Rostov, �this is such a lofty, such a beautiful feeling, such a��

�I believe it, my friend, I believe it, and I share it and approve��

�No, you don�t understand!�

And Rostov got up and began wandering among the campfires, dreaming of what happiness it would be to die, not saving the life (he dared not even dream of that), but simply to die before the eyes of the sovereign. He was indeed in love with the tsar, and with the glory of Russian arms, and with the hope of the future triumph. And he was not the only one who experienced that feeling in those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love, though less rapturously, with their tsar and with the glory of Russian arms.


XI

The next day the sovereign stayed at Wischau. The court physician Villiers was summoned to him several times. In headquarters and among the nearby troops the news spread that the sovereign was unwell. He had eaten nothing and slept poorly that night, as people close to him said. The cause of it was the strong impression made on the sovereign�s sensitive soul by the sight of the wounded and dead.

At dawn on the seventeenth, a French officer was sent to Wischau from our outposts, who had come under a flag of truce, asking for a meeting with the Russian emperor. This officer was Savary. The sovereign had only just fallen asleep, and therefore Savary had to wait. At noon he was admitted to the sovereign, and an hour later he rode with Prince Dolgorukov to the outposts of the French army.

As rumor had it, the purpose of sending Savary was to propose peace and to propose a meeting between the emperor Alexander and Napoleon. A personal meeting, to the joy and pride of the whole army, was refused, and instead of the sovereign, Prince Dolgorukov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon, on the chance that these negotiations, contrary to expectation, had as their purpose a real desire for peace.

In the evening Dolgorukov came back, went straight to the sovereign, and spent a long time alone with him.

On the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the troops made two more marches forward, and the enemy�s outposts retreated after brief exchanges of fire. In the highest spheres of the army, an intense, bustlingly agitated movement began from noon of the nineteenth, continuing until the morning of the next day, the twentieth of November, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz took place.

Until noon on the nineteenth, the movement, animated conversation, running, and sending of adjutants were limited to the emperors� headquarters; after noon of the same day the movement spread to the headquarters of Kutuzov and the staffs of the leaders of columns. By evening this movement had spread through adjutants to all ends and parts of the army, and during the night of the nineteenth to the twentieth, rising up from its night camp, humming with talk, the eighty-thousand-man mass of the allied army undulated and set off in a huge six-mile sheet.

The concentrated movement which began that morning in the emperors� headquarters and gave a push to all subsequent movement was like the first movement of the central wheel in a big tower clock. Slowly one wheel started, another turned, a third, and the wheels, pulleys, and gears were set turning more and more quickly, chimes began to ring, figures popped out, and the clock hands started their measured advance, showing the result of that movement.

As in the mechanism of a clock, so also in the mechanism of military action, the movement once given is just as irrepressible until the final results, and just as indifferently motionless are the parts of the mechanism not yet involved in the action even a moment before movement is transmitted to them. Wheels whizz on their axles, cogs catch, fast-spinning pulleys whirr, yet the neighboring wheel is as calm and immobile as though it was ready to stand for a hundred years in that immobility; but a moment comes�the lever catches, and, obedient to its movement, the wheel creaks, turning, and merges into one movement with the whole, the result and purpose of which are incomprehensible to it.

As in a clock the result of the complex movement of numberless wheels and pulleys is merely the slow and measured movement of the hands pointing to the time, so also the result of all the complex human movements of these hundred and sixty thousand Russians and French�all the passions, desires, regrets, humiliations, sufferings, bursts of pride, fear, rapture�was merely the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the so-called battle of the three emperors, that is, a slow movement of the world-historical hand on the clockface of human history.

Prince Andrei was on duty that day and constantly by the commander in chief.

After five in the evening, Kutuzov came to the emperors� headquarters and, having spent a short time with the sovereign, went to see the grand marshal of the court, Count Tolstoy.

Bolkonsky made use of this time to go to Dolgorukov and find out the details of the action. Prince Andrei sensed that Kutuzov was upset and displeased about something, and that there was displeasure with him at headquarters, and that all the persons of the imperial headquarters used with him the tone of people who knew something that others did not, and therefore he wanted to talk with Dolgorukov.

�Well, greetings, mon cher,� said Dolgorukov, who was having tea with Bilibin. �The f&#234;te is tomorrow. How�s your old man? In a bad humor?�

�I wouldn�t say he�s in a bad humor, but it seems he�d like to be heard.�

�He was heard at the council of war and will be heard when he talks to the point; but to drag our feet and wait for something now, when Bonaparte is afraid of a general battle more than anything�is impossible.�

�So you saw him?� asked Prince Andrei. �Well, what is Bonaparte like? What impression did he make on you?�

�Yes, I saw him and became convinced that he is afraid of a general battle more than anything in the world,� Dolgorukov repeated, obviously cherishing this overall conclusion which he had come to after his meeting with Napoleon. �If he wasn�t afraid of a battle, what would make him ask for this meeting, conduct negotiations, and, above all, retreat, when retreat is so contrary to his whole method of conducting war? Believe me, he�s afraid, afraid of a general battle, his hour has come. That I can tell you.�

�But tell me, how is he, what�s he like?� Prince Andrei asked again.

�He�s a man in a gray frock coat, who wished very much that I would say �Your Majesty� to him, but, to his regret, did not receive any titles from me. That�s what he�s like, and nothing more,� Dolgorukov replied, glancing at Bilibin with a smile.

�Despite my full respect for old Kutuzov,� he went on, �what good ones we�d all be, waiting for something and giving him a chance to escape or trick us, whereas now he�s certainly in our hands. No, we mustn�t forget Suvorov and his rules: don�t put yourself in a position to be attacked, but attack yourself. Believe me, in war the energy of young men often points to a surer way than all the experience of the old cunctators.�

�But in what position are we going to attack him? I was at the outposts today, and it�s impossible to tell precisely where he�s camped with his main forces,� said Prince Andrei.

He wanted to explain to Dolgorukov the plan of attack he had worked out for himself.

�Oh, that makes no difference at all,� Dolgorukov began speaking quickly, getting up and unfolding a map on the table. �All the possibilities have been foreseen: if he�s camped by Br&#252;nn��

And Prince Dolgorukov quickly and vaguely recounted Weyrother�s plan for a flanking movement.

Prince Andrei started to object and demonstrate his own plan, which might have been just as good as Weyrother�s, but had the shortcoming that Weyrother�s had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrei began to demonstrate the disadvantages of the latter and the advantages of his own, Prince Dolgorukov stopped listening to him, and gazed absentmindedly not at the map, but at Prince Andrei�s face.

�Anyhow, there�ll be a council of war at Kutuzov�s today: you can speak all this out there,� said Dolgorukov.

�I�ll do just that,� said Prince Andrei, stepping away from the map.

�What are you worrying about, gentlemen?� asked Bilibin, who up to then had been listening to their conversation with a merry smile and was now obviously going to come out with a quip. �Whether there�s victory or defeat tomorrow, the glory of Russian arms is assured. Besides your Kutuzov, there�s not a single Russian leader of a column. The leaders are: Herr General Wimpfen, le comte de Langeron, le prince de Liechtenstein, le prince de Hohenloe, et enfin Prsch�Prsch�et ainsi de suite, comme tous les noms polonais.�

�Taisez-vous, mauvaise langue,� said Dolgorukov. �It�s not true, there are now two Russians: Miloradovich and Dokhturov, and there would have been a third, Count Arakcheev, but he has weak nerves.�

�However, I think Mikhail Ilarionovich has come out,� said Prince Andrei. �I wish you luck and success, gentlemen,� he added and left, after shaking hands with Dolgorukov and Bilibin.

On the way home, Prince Andrei could not help asking Kutuzov, who was sitting silently next to him, what he thought about the next day�s battle.

Kutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant, paused, and said:

�I think the battle will be lost, and I said so to Count Tolstoy and asked him to convey it to the sovereign. And what do you think he replied? Eh, mon cher g&#233;n&#233;ral, je me m&#234;le de riz et des c&#244;telettes, m&#234;lez-vous des affaires de la guerre. Yes�That was the answer I got!�


XII

After nine in the evening, Weyrother moved with his plans to Kutuzov�s quarters, where a council of war was called. All the leaders of columns were summoned to the commander in chief, and, apart from Bagration, who refused to come, they all arrived at the appointed time.

Weyrother, who was fully in charge of the forthcoming battle, presented, in his liveliness and briskness, a sharp contrast with the displeased and drowsy Kutuzov, who reluctantly played the role of chairman and leader of the council of war. Weyrother obviously felt himself at the head of the movement which had now become irrepressible. He was like a horse harnessed to a wagon and running downhill. Whether he was pulling or being pushed, he did not know; but he was racing with all possible speed, having no time left to discuss what this movement would lead to. That evening Weyrother had gone twice to inspect the enemy lines in person and twice to the emperors, Russian and Austrian, to report and explain, and then to his office, where he had dictated the German disposition. Exhausted, he now arrived at Kutuzov�s.

He was clearly so preoccupied that he even forgot to be respectful with the commander in chief: he interrupted him, spoke quickly, unclearly, not looking into his interlocutor�s eyes, not answering the questions put to him, was covered with mud, and looked pitiful, exhausted, disconcerted, and at the same time presumptuous and proud.

Kutuzov occupied a modest nobleman�s castle near Ostralitz. In the big drawing room, turned into the commander in chief�s office, were gathered: Kutuzov himself, Weyrother, and the members of the council of war. They were having tea. They were only waiting for Prince Bagration in order to begin the council of war. Finally, after seven o�clock Prince Bagration�s orderly officer arrived with the news that the prince could not be there. Prince Andrei came in to report that to the commander in chief, and, availing himself of the permission given him earlier by Kutuzov to be present at the council, remained in the room.

�Since Prince Bagration won�t be coming, we can begin,� said Weyrother, hurriedly getting up from his place and approaching the table, on which an enormous map of the environs of Br&#252;nn was spread.

Kutuzov, in an unbuttoned uniform, from which his fat neck, as if released, poured out over the collar, was sitting in a Voltaire armchair, his pudgy old man�s hands placed symmetrically on the two armrests, and was almost asleep. At the sound of Weyrother�s voice, he opened his one eye with effort.

�Yes, yes, please, or it will get late,� he said, and, nodding his head, lowered it and again closed his eye.

If the members of the council at first thought Kutuzov was pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose produced during the reading that followed proved that for the commander in chief at that moment the point of the matter was something far more important than a wish to show his contempt for the disposition or for anything at all: the point of the matter was to satisfy the irresistible human need for sleep. He was indeed asleep. Weyrother, with the gesture of a man who is too busy to waste even a moment of his time, glanced at Kutuzov and, assuring himself that he was asleep, took up the paper and began to read the disposition for the future battle in a loud, monotonous tone, under the title, which he also read:

�Disposition for the attack on the enemy�s position behind Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz, 20 November 1805.�

The disposition was very complex and difficult. The original began:

Da der Feind mit seinem linken Fl&#252;gel an die mit Wald bedeckten Berge lehnt und sich mit seinem rechten Fl&#252;gel l&#228;ngs Kobelnitz und Sokolnitz hinter die dort befindlichen Teiche zieht, wir im Gegenteil mit unserem linken Fl&#252;gel seinen rechten sehr debordieren, so ist es vorteilhaft letzteren Fl&#252;gel des Feindes zu attakieren, besonders wenn wir die D&#246;rfer Sokolnitz und Kobelnitz im Besitze haben, wodurch wir dem Feind zugleich in die Flanke fallen und ihn auf der Fl&#228;che zwischen Schlapanitz und dem Thuerassa-Walde verfolgen k&#246;nnen, indem wir dem Defileen von Schlapanitz und Bellowitz ausweichen, welche die feindliche Front decken. Zu diesem Endzwecke ist es n&#246;tig�die erste Kolonne marschiert�die zweite Kolonne marschiert�die dritte Kolonne marschiert�� and so on, read Weyrother. The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult disposition. The tall, fair-haired General Buxh&#246;wden stood leaning his back against the wall, and, resting his eyes on the burning candle, seemed not to be listening and even not to want it to be thought that he was listening. Directly opposite Weyrother, fixing his shining, wide-open eyes on him, in a martial pose, hands on his knees, elbows turned out, sat ruddy Miloradovich, with raised-up mustache and shoulders. He was obstinately silent, staring into Weyrother�s face, and took his eyes off him only when the Austrian chief of staff fell silent. Then Miloradovich looked around significantly at the other generals. But by the significance of this significant gaze it was impossible to tell whether he agreed or disagreed, was satisfied or dissatisfied with the disposition. Closest of all to Weyrother, Count Langeron sat and, with a subtle smile on his southern French face, which did not abandon him throughout the reading, gazed at his slender fingers, quickly twirling by the corners a golden snuffbox with a portrait. In the middle of one of the longest periods, he stopped the spinning movement of the snuffbox, raised his head, and, with an unpleasant politeness at the very corners of his thin lips, interrupted Weyrother and wanted to say something; but the Austrian general, without breaking off his reading, frowned angrily and waved his elbows, as if to say: later, later you can tell me your thoughts, but now kindly look at the map and listen. Langeron looked up with an expression of perplexity, glanced at Miloradovich as if seeking an explanation, but, meeting Miloradovich�s significant gaze, which signified nothing, he sadly lowered his eyes and again began twirling the snuffbox.

�Une le&#231;on de g&#233;ographie,� he said, as if to himself, but loudly enough to be heard.

Przebyszewski, with deferential but dignified politeness, put his hand to his ear towards Weyrother, having the air of a man whose attention is absorbed. The short Dokhturov sat directly opposite Weyrother with a diligent and modest look, and, bending over the spread-out map, conscientiously studied the disposition and the unfamiliar terrain. He asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had not heard properly and the difficult names of the villages. Weyrother did as he asked, and Dokhturov wrote them down.

When the reading, which lasted more than an hour, was over, Langeron again stopped the snuffbox and, without looking at Weyrother or anyone in particular, began speaking about the difficulty of following such a disposition, in which the position of the enemy is assumed to be known, when that position may not be known to us, since the enemy is on the move. Langeron�s objections were well-founded, but it was obvious that the purpose of those objections consisted primarily in bringing it home to General Weyrother, who had read his disposition with such self-assurance, as if to schoolboys, that he had to do not with mere fools, but with people who could give him lessons in military matters. When the monotonous sound of Weyrother�s voice fell silent, Kutuzov opened his eyes, like a miller who wakes up at an interruption of the soporific sound of the mill wheels, listened to what Langeron was saying, and�as if to say, �Ah, you�re still going on about these stupidities!��quickly closed his eyes and lowered his head still more.

Trying to offend Weyrother as stingingly as he could in his amour propre as a military author, Langeron demonstrated that Bonaparte could easily attack, instead of being attacked, and thereby make this disposition totally useless. Weyrother responded to all his objections with a firm, contemptuous smile, obviously prepared beforehand for every objection, regardless of what might be said to him.

�If he could attack us, he would have done so today,� he said.

�You think, then, that he is powerless?� asked Langeron.

�He has forty thousand men, if that,� Weyrother replied, with the smile of a doctor being told by a wise woman how to treat a patient.

�In that case he�s going to his destruction by waiting for our attack,� Langeron said with a subtle, ironic smile, again glancing for support to Miloradovich, who was nearest to him.

But at that moment Miloradovich was obviously thinking least of all of what the generals were arguing about.

�Ma foi,� he said, �tomorrow we�ll see it all on the battlefield.�

Weyrother again smiled that same ironic smile, which said that to him it was ridiculous and strange to meet objections from Russian generals and prove that of which he was not only all too well assured himself, but of which he had assured the two emperors.

�The enemy has put out his fires, and a continual noise is heard from his camp,� he said. �What does that mean? Either he is retreating, which is the one thing we should fear, or he is changing his position� (he smiled). �But even if he takes up a position in Thuerassa, he is only saving us a great deal of trouble, and all orders, to the smallest detail, remain the same.�

�But how is that?�� said Prince Andrei, who had already been waiting a long time for a chance to express his doubts.

Kutuzov woke up, cleared his throat loudly, and glanced around at the generals.

�Gentlemen, the disposition for tomorrow, for today even (because it�s already past twelve), cannot be changed,� he said. �You have heard it, and we will all do our duty. And there�s nothing more important before a battle�� (he paused) �than a good night�s sleep.�

He made as if to rise. The generals bowed and withdrew. It was already past midnight. Prince Andrei left.

The council of war, at which Prince Andrei had not managed to speak out his opinion as he had hoped to, left in him a vague and disturbing impression. Who was right�Dolgorukov and Weyrother, or Kutuzov and Langeron and the others who did not approve the plan of attack�he did not know. �But was it really impossible for Kutuzov to speak his mind directly to the sovereign? Can it really not be done otherwise? Can it really be that, for court and personal considerations, tens of thousands of lives must be risked�and my own, my life?� he thought.

�Yes, I may very well be killed tomorrow,� he thought. And suddenly, with that thought of death, a whole series of the most remote and most soul-felt memories arose in his imagination; he remembered his last farewell from his father and his wife; he remembered the first time of his love for her; remembered her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself; and in an emotionally softened and troubled state, he left the cottage in which he was billeted with Nesvitsky and began pacing in front of the house.

The night was misty, and through the mist moonlight shone mysteriously. �Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow!� he thought. �Tomorrow maybe everything will be over for me, all these memories will be no more, all these memories will simply have no more sense for me. Tomorrow maybe�even certainly, I have a presentiment of it�for the first time I�ll finally have to show all I can do.� And he imagined the battle, its loss, the concentration of the fighting at one point, and the bewilderment of all the superiors. And here that happy moment, that Toulon he has so long awaited, finally presents itself to him. He voices his opinion firmly and clearly to Kutuzov and Weyrother, and to the emperors. All are struck by the correctness of his thinking, but no one undertakes to carry it out, and here he takes a regiment, a division, negotiates the condition that no one interfere with his instructions, and leads his division to the decisive point, and alone wins the victory. �And death and suffering?� says another voice. But Prince Andrei does not respond to that voice and goes on with his successes. The disposition for the next battle he does alone. He bears the title of an officer on duty in Kutuzov�s army, but he does everything alone. He alone wins the next battle. Kutuzov is replaced, he is appointed��Well, and then?� the other voice says again. �And then, if you�re not wounded, killed, or deceived ten times over�well, then what?� �Well, then�� Prince Andrei answers himself, �I don�t know what will happen then, I don�t want to know and I can�t know; but if I want this, want glory, want to be known to people, want to be loved by them, it�s not my fault that I want it, that it�s the only thing I want, the only thing I live for. Yes, the only thing! I�ll never tell it to anyone, but my God! what am I to do if I love nothing except glory, except people�s love? Death, wounds, loss of family, nothing frightens me. And however near and dear many people are to me�my father, my sister, my wife�the dearest people to me�but, however terrible and unnatural it seems, I�d give them all now for a moment of glory, of triumph over people, for love from people I don�t know and will never know, for the love of these people here,� he thought, listening to the talk in Kutuzov�s yard. From Kutuzov�s yard came the voices of orderlies preparing to sleep; one voice, probably of a coachman who was teasing Kutuzov�s old cook, whom Prince Andrei knew and whose name was Titus, said: �Titus, hey, Titus?�

�Well?� replied the old man.

�Titus, don�t bite us,� said the joker.

�Pah, go to the devil,� a voice cried, drowned out by the guffawing of the orderlies and servants.

�And still the only thing I love and cherish is triumph over all of them, I cherish that mysterious power and glory hovering over me here in this mist!�


XIII

That night Rostov was on the picket line with his platoon forward of Bagration�s detachment. His hussars were scattered in pairs along the line; he himself rode the line on horseback, trying to fight off the sleep that was irresistibly overcoming him. Behind him could be seen the immense expanse of our army�s campfires burning dimly in the mist; ahead of him was misty darkness. However much Rostov peered into this misty distance, he saw nothing: now some grayish, some blackish shape seemed to appear; now it was as if lights flickered where the enemy ought to be; now it seemed only some glimmer in his own eyes. His eyes kept closing, and in his imagination the sovereign appeared, then Denisov, then Moscow memories, and he hurriedly opened his eyes again and saw close in front of him the head and ears of the horse he was riding, sometimes the black figures of hussars, when he came within six paces of them, and in the distance the same misty darkness. �Why not? It might well be,� thought Rostov, �that the sovereign, meeting me, gives me some assignment, saying as to any officer: �Go and find out what�s there.� There are many stories about how he got to know some officer quite by chance and attached him to himself. What if he attached me to himself? Oh, how I�d protect him, how I�d tell him the whole truth, how I�d expose the deceivers!� And so as to picture vividly to himself his love and devotion for the sovereign, he pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he delighted not only in killing, but in slapping in the face before the sovereign�s eyes. Suddenly a distant cry aroused Rostov. He gave a start and opened his eyes.

�Where am I? Ah, yes, in the line; watchword and password��shaft,� �Olm&#252;tz.� How vexing that our squadron will be in reserve tomorrow�� he thought. �I�ll ask to be sent into action. That may be the only chance I�ll get to see the sovereign. Yes, it�s not long now till we�re relieved. I�ll make another round, and as soon as I get back, I�ll go to the general and ask him.� He righted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse, in order to make one more round of his hussars. He thought it was getting lighter. To the left he could see a sloping, lit-up hillside and across from it a black knoll that seemed steep as a wall. On this knoll was a white spot that Rostov could not make sense of: was it a moonlit clearing in the woods, or some leftover snow, or some white houses? It even seemed to him that something was moving on that white spot. �It must be snow�this spot; a spot�une tache,� thought Rostov. �Tache or no tache��

�Natasha, my sister, dark eyes. Na�tashka�(She�ll be so surprised when I tell her how I saw the sovereign!) Natashka�take the�tashka�� �Keep to the right, Your Honor, there�s bushes here,� said the voice of a hussar whom Rostov, falling asleep, was riding past. Rostov suddenly raised his head, which had already dropped to his horse�s mane, and stopped beside the hussar. A young, childish sleep was irresistibly coming over him. �But what was I thinking? I mustn�t forget. How am I going to speak with the sovereign? No, not that�that�s for tomorrow. Yes, yes! Na-tashka�at-tack a�attack who? Hussars. Whose hussars? The hussar you saw ride down the boulevard, remember, just across from Guryev house�Old man Guryev�Eh, nice fellow, Denisov! But that�s all trifles. The main thing now is that the sovereign�s here. How he looked at me, and he wanted to say something, but he didn�t dare�No, it was I who didn�t dare. But that�s all trifles, the main thing is not to forget that I was thinking of something important, yes. Na-tashka, at-tack a�yes, yes, yes. That�s good.� And again his head dropped to his horse�s neck. Suddenly it seemed to him that he was being shot at. �What? What?�Cut them down! What?�� said Rostov, coming to his senses. The moment he opened his eyes, Rostov heard ahead of him, where the enemy was, the drawn-out cries of thousands of voices. His horse and the hussar�s who was standing next to him pricked up their ears at these cries. In the place where the cries came from, a little fire flared up and went out, then another, then all along the line of French troops on the hill fires flared up and the cries grew louder and louder. Rostov heard the sounds of French words but could not make them out. Too many voices were shouting. All that was heard was: aaaa! and rrrr!

�What is it? What do you think?� Rostov turned to the hussar standing beside him. �Is it from the enemy?�

The hussar did not reply.

�What, don�t you hear it?� Rostov asked again, after waiting some time for a reply.

�Who knows, Your Honor,� the hussar replied reluctantly.

�By the place, it should be the enemy,� Rostov repeated.

�Maybe him, or maybe just so,� the hussar said, �a night thing. Easy, now!� he cried to his horse, who was stirring under him.

Rostov�s horse was also restive, stamping its hoof on the frozen ground, listening to the sounds and looking at the fires. The cries of the voices grew louder and louder and merged in a general clamor that only an army of several thousand could produce. The lights spread more and more, probably along the line of the French camp. Rostov was no longer sleepy. The cheerful, triumphant cries from the enemy army had an exhilarating effect on him. Rostov could now hear clearly: �Vive l�empereur, l�empereur!�

�It�s nearby�must be across the stream,� he said to the hussar standing beside him.

The hussar only sighed, making no reply, and cleared his throat angrily. Down the line of hussars the hoofbeats of a trotting horse were heard, and suddenly out of the night mist, looking like a huge elephant, emerged the figure of a hussar sergeant.

�The generals, Your Honor!� said the sergeant, riding up to Rostov.

Rostov, still looking towards the fires and cries, rode with the sergeant to meet several horsemen who were riding along the line. One was on a white horse. Prince Bagration and Prince Dolgorukov, with their adjutants, had ridden out to look at the strange phenomenon of the fires and cries in the enemy army. Rostov, riding up to Bagration, reported to him and joined the adjutants, trying to hear what the generals were saying.

�Believe me,� said Prince Dolgorukov, addressing Bagration, �this is nothing but a ruse: he has retreated and has ordered the rear guard to light fires and make noise in order to deceive us.�

�Hardly,� said Bagration. �I saw them on that knoll this evening; if they had left, they would have pulled out from there as well. Officer,� Prince Bagration turned to Rostov, �are his pickets still posted there?�

�This evening they were. But now I can�t tell, Your Excellency. Give the order, and I�ll go there with my hussars,� said Rostov.

Bagration stopped and, without replying, tried to make out Rostov�s face in the mist.

�Go, then,� he said, after a brief silence.

�Yes, sir.�

Rostov spurred his horse, called Sergeant Fedchenko and two more hussars, told them to follow him, and rode at a trot down the hill in the direction of the continuing cries. Rostov felt both frightened and elated to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance, where no one had been before him. Bagration shouted to him from above not to go beyond the brook, but Rostov pretended not to hear his words, and, without stopping, rode further and further on, constantly making mistakes, taking bushes for trees and hollows for people, and constantly explaining his mistakes to himself. Having trotted down the hill, he no longer saw either our own or the enemy�s fires, but he heard the cries of the French more loudly and clearly. In the bottom he saw before him something like a stream, but when he reached it, he recognized it as a trodden road. Coming out onto the road, he reined in his horse, undecided whether to follow it or to cross and ride over the black field up the hillside. To ride along the road, which stood out lighter in the mist, was less dangerous, because he could see people better. �Follow me!� he said, crossed the road, and began to gallop up the hill to the place where French pickets had been posted in the evening.

�There he is, Your Honor!� one of the hussars said behind him.

And before Rostov had time to make out something that loomed up black in the mist, a flash gleamed, a shot cracked, and a bullet, as if complaining about something, whined high up in the mist and flew out of earshot. A second musket misfired, but there was a flash in the pan. Rostov turned his horse and galloped back. Four more shots rang out at various intervals, and bullets went singing in various tones somewhere in the mist. Rostov reined in his horse, who was elated like himself by the shooting, and rode on slowly. �More now, more now!� a cheerful voice was saying in his soul. But there was no more shooting.

Only as he approached Bagration, Rostov sent his horse into a gallop again and, with his hand to his visor, rode up to him.

Dolgorukov was still insisting on his opinion that the French had retreated and lit fires only to deceive us.

�What does that prove?� he was saying as Rostov rode up to them. �They could retreat and leave pickets.�

�Clearly they have not all left, Prince,� said Bagration. �Till tomorrow morning, tomorrow we�ll find out everything.�

�There are pickets on the hill, Your Excellency, in the same place as this evening,� Rostov reported, bending forward, holding his hand to his visor, and unable to repress a cheerful smile, called up in him by his ride and above all by the whine of the bullets.

�Very good, very good,� said Bagration, �thank you, Lieutenant.�

�Your Excellency,� said Rostov, �allow me to make a request.�

�What is it?�

�Tomorrow our squadron is assigned to the reserves. Allow me to request that you attach me to the first squadron.�

�What is your name?�

�Count Rostov.�

�Ah, very well. Stay with me as an orderly officer.�

�Are you Ilya Andreich�s son?� asked Dolgorukov.

But Rostov did not reply.

�So I�ll be counting on it, Your Excellency.�

�I will give the order.�

�Tomorrow,� thought Rostov, �I may very well be sent on some sort of mission to the sovereign. Thank God!�

The cries and fires in the enemy army came from the fact that, while Napoleon�s orders were being read to the troops, the emperor himself rode around his bivouacs. The soldiers, seeing the emperor, set fire to bundles of straw and ran after him, shouting, �Vive l�empereur!� Napoleon�s orders were the following:


Soldiers! The Russian army is marching against us in order to avenge the Austrian army of Ulm. These are the same battalions that you crushed at Hollabrunn and have since been pursuing constantly as far as this place. The positions we occupy are strong, and while they move to surround me on the right, they will expose their flank to me! Soldiers! I myself will direct your battalions. I will stay out of fire if you, with your usual courage, bring disorder and confusion to the enemy�s ranks; but if victory should be doubtful even for a moment, you will see your emperor subjecting himself to the first blows of the enemy, because there can be no hesitations about victory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of the French infantry, which is so necessary to the honor of our nation.

Do not break ranks on the pretext of removing the wounded! Let each of you be fully pervaded by the thought that we must defeat these mercenaries of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation. This victory will end our campaign, and we will be able to return to our winter quarters, where new French troops, now being raised in France, will find us; and then the peace which I will conclude will be worthy of my people, you, and myself.

Napoleon.


XIV

At five o�clock in the morning it was still quite dark. The troops of the center, the reserves, and Bagration�s right flank still stood motionless, but on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery which were to be the first to descend from the heights in order to attack the French right flank and drive them back to the Bohemian Mountains, according to the disposition, had already begun to stir and get up from their night camp. The smoke of the bonfires, onto which everything superfluous was thrown, stung the eyes. It was cold and dark. Officers hastily drank tea and ate breakfast, soldiers chewed on biscuits, beat their feet to warm them up, and streamed towards the bonfires, throwing onto them the remains of their lean-tos, chairs, tables, wheels, barrels, everything superfluous which it was impossible to take with them. Austrian column leaders shuttled among the Russian troops and served as heralds of the departure. As soon as an Austrian officer appeared at a regimental commander�s camp, the regiment began to stir: soldiers ran from the bonfires, stuffed pipes into boot tops, bags into wagons, took their muskets and fell in. Officers buttoned their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches, and strode along the ranks, calling out; carters and orderlies harnessed, packed, and tied down the wagons. Adjutants, battalion and regimental commanders mounted up, crossed themselves, gave final orders, instructions, and commissions to those who were staying with the train, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet began. Columns started to move, not knowing where and, owing to the surrounding people, the smoke, and the thickening fog, seeing neither the place they were leaving nor the place they were going to.

A soldier in movement is as hemmed in, limited, and borne along by his regiment as a sailor by his ship. However far he may go, whatever strange, unknown, and dangerous latitudes he gets into, around him�as for the sailor always and everywhere there are the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship�always and everywhere there are the same comrades, the same ranks, the same sergeant major Ivan Mitrich, the same company dog Zhuchka, the same superiors. A soldier rarely wishes to know what latitudes his whole ship has gotten to; but on the day of battle, God knows how and from where, a stern note is heard in the moral world of the troops, the same for everyone, which sounds the approach of something decisive and solemn and arouses in them an unaccustomed curiosity. On days of battle, soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment, listen intently, look about, and greedily inquire into what is going on around them.

The fog was so thick that, though day was breaking, one could not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like enormous trees, level places like cliffs and slopes. Everywhere, on all sides, one might run into an enemy invisible ten paces away. But the columns marched for a long time through the same fog, going down and up hills, past gardens and fences, over new, incomprehensible terrain, without coming across the enemy anywhere. On the contrary, the soldiers realized that ahead, behind, on all sides, our Russian columns were moving in the same direction. Every soldier felt pleased at heart, knowing that many, many more Russian soldiers were going where he was going, that is, no one knew where.

�See there, the Kursky lads just marched by,� came from one of the ranks.

�It�s scary, brother, the troops we�ve gathered! Last night I looked, when they lit the fires, there was no end of them. Moscow�in short!�

Though none of the column leaders rode up to the ranks and spoke to the soldiers (the column leaders, as we saw at the council of war, were ill-humored and displeased with the action undertaken and therefore were only following orders and did not bother cheering up the soldiers), despite that, the soldiers marched on cheerily, as always when going into action, especially on the offensive. But, having gone for about an hour in the thick fog, the major part of the troops were forced to halt, and an unpleasant awareness of disorder and muddleheadedness passed through the ranks. How such awareness is conveyed is quite difficult to define; but it is unquestionable that it is conveyed with extraordinary sureness, and flows swiftly, imperceptibly and irresistibly, like water through a glen. If the Russian army had been alone, without allies, much time might still have passed before this awareness of disorder became a general conviction; but now, ascribing the cause of the disorder with particular pleasure and naturalness to the muddleheaded Germans, everyone became convinced that the harmful confusion taking place was the doing of the sausage makers.

�What�s the holdup? Is the way blocked? Or have we already run into the French?�

�No, doesn�t sound like it. Otherwise they�d have started shooting.�

�So they were in a hurry to get started, but once they got started�here we stand witless in the middle of a field�it�s all these cursed Germans confusing things. What muddleheaded devils!�

�So I�d have let them take the lead. But no, they huddle in the rear. And now we stand here on empty stomachs.�

�Well, how long will it be? They say the cavalry�s blocked the road,� said an officer.

�Eh, the cursed Germans, they don�t know their own country!� said another.

�What division are you?� an adjutant shouted, riding up.

�The eighteenth.�

�Then what are you doing here? You should have gone ahead long ago; now you won�t get through till evening. Such stupid orders; they don�t know what they�re doing themselves,� the officer said and rode off.

Then a general rode by and angrily shouted something not in Russian.

�Tafa-lafa, and there�s no telling what he�s mumbling,� a soldier said, mimicking the general as he rode off. �I�d shoot the scoundrels!�

�We were ordered to be in place before nine, but we�re not halfway there. What orders!� was repeated from different sides.

And the feeling of energy with which the troops had set out for action began to turn into vexation and anger at the muddleheaded orders and the Germans.

The reason for the confusion was that, while the Austrian cavalry was moving on the left flank, the superior officers decided that our center was too far from the right flank, and the entire cavalry was ordered to cross over to the right. Several thousand cavalry were advancing ahead of the infantry, and the infantry was forced to wait.

At the head, a confrontation took place between an Austrian column leader and a Russian general. The Russian general shouted, demanding that the cavalry be stopped; the Austrian insisted that the fault lay not with him but with the superior officers. The troops meanwhile stood there, bored and losing heart. After an hour�s delay, the troops finally moved on and began to descend the hill. The fog, which was lifting on the hilltop, only grew thicker in the bottom where the troops were descending. At the head, in the fog, a shot rang out, then another, at first irregularly, at various intervals: trata�tat, then more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach stream began.

Not counting on meeting the enemy below, by the stream, and coming upon them by chance in the fog, hearing not a word of encouragement from the superior officers, with the awareness spread among the troops that they were late, and, above all, seeing nothing ahead or around them in the thick fog, the Russians lazily and slowly exchanged fire with the enemy, moved forward and again halted, not receiving timely orders from the officers and adjutants, who wandered through the fog over the unfamiliar terrain, unable to find their units. Thus the action began for the first, second, and third columns, which had descended the hill. The fourth column, with which Kutuzov himself was, occupied the Pratzen heights.

In the bottom, where the action began, the fog was still thick; up above it had cleared, but nothing of what was happening ahead could be seen. Whether all the enemy forces were six miles away from us, as we supposed, or were there in that fog, no one knew until past eight o�clock.

It was nine o�clock in the morning. An unbroken sea of fog spread below, but at the village of Schlapanitz, on the heights, where Napoleon stood, surrounded by his marshals, it was perfectly light. Over him was the clear blue sky, and the enormous ball of the sun, like an enormous, hollow, crimson float, bobbed on the surface of the milky sea of fog. The whole French army, including Napoleon himself and his staff, not only were not on the far side of the streams and bottomland of the villages of Sokolnitz and Schlapanitz, where we intended to take up a position and begin the action, but were on the near side, so close to our troops that Napoleon with his naked eye could distinguish between our troops on horseback and on foot. Napoleon sat a little in front of his marshals on a small gray Arabian horse, in his dark blue greatcoat, the same in which he had made the Italian campaign. He peered silently at the hills, which seemed to rise up from the sea of fog, and over which Russian troops were moving in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of gunfire in the hollow. On his face, still lean at that time, not a muscle stirred; his glistening eyes were fixed motionlessly on one place. His conjectures turned out to be correct. Part of the Russian army had already descended into the hollow towards the ponds and lakes, part was still clearing off from the Pratzen heights, which he intended to attack and considered the key to the position. He saw amidst the fog, in the depression between two hills near the village of Pratz, Russian columns, their bayonets glittering, moving all in one direction towards the hollows, and disappearing one after another into the sea of fog. From the information he had received in the evening, from the sounds of wheels and footsteps heard during the night at the outposts, from the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, from all his conjectures, he saw clearly that the allies considered him to be far ahead of them, that the columns moving near Pratz constituted the center of the Russian army, and that the center was already sufficiently weakened for him to attack it successfully. But he still did not begin the action.

That day was a solemn day for him�the anniversary of his coronation. Before morning he had dozed off for a few hours and, healthy, cheerful, fresh, in that happy state of mind in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field. He stood motionless, gazing at the heights appearing from the fog, and on his cold face there was that particular tinge of self-confident, well-deserved happiness that can be seen on the face of a boy who has happily fallen in love. His marshals stood behind him, not daring to distract his attention. He looked now at the Pratzen heights, now at the sun floating out of the fog.

When the sun had fully emerged from the fog and its dazzling brilliance sprayed over the fields and the fog (it was as if he had only been waiting for that to begin the action), he took the glove from his beautiful white hand, made a sign to the marshals, and gave the order for the action to begin. The marshals, accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in various directions, and a few minutes later the main forces of the French army were moving swiftly towards those same Pratzen heights from which the Russian troops had cleared off more and more, descending to the left into the hollow.


XV

At eight o�clock Kutuzov rode to Pratz at the head of Miloradovich�s fourth column, the one which was to take the place of the columns of Przebyszewski and Langeron, which had already gone down. He greeted the men of the head regiment and gave the order to move, thus showing that he intended to lead the column himself. Having ridden to the village of Pratz, he halted. Prince Andrei, one of the enormous number of persons constituting the commander in chief�s suite, stood behind him. Prince Andrei felt excited, irritated, and at the same time restrainedly calm, as a man usually is when a long-desired moment comes. He was firmly convinced that this was the day of his Toulon or his bridge of Arcole. How it would happen, he did not know, but he was firmly convinced that it would be so. The locality and position of our troops were known to him, as far as they could be known to anyone in our army. His own strategic plan, which there obviously could be no thought of carrying out now, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother�s plan, Prince Andrei pondered the possible happenstances and came up with new considerations, such as might call for his swiftness of reflection and decisiveness.

To the left below, in the fog, exchanges of fire between unseen troops could be heard. There, it seemed to Prince Andrei, the battle would concentrate, there an obstacle would be encountered, and �it�s there that I�ll be sent with a brigade or division, and there, with a standard in my hand, I�ll go forward and crush everything ahead of me.�

Prince Andrei could not look with indifference at the standards of the battalions going past him. Looking at a standard, he thought: maybe it is that very standard with which I�ll have to march at the head of the troops.

By morning the night�s fog had left only hoarfrost turning into dew on the heights, but in the hollows the fog still spread its milk-white sea. Nothing could be seen in that hollow to the left, into which our troops had descended and from which came the sounds of gunfire. Over the heights was a dark, clear sky, and to the right�the enormous ball of the sun. Far ahead, on the other shore of the sea of fog, one could make out the jutting, wooded hills on which the enemy army was supposed to be, and something was discernible. To the right the guards were entering the region of the fog, with a sound of tramping and wheels and an occasional gleam of bayonets; to the left, beyond the village, similar masses of cavalry approached and disappeared into the sea of fog. In front and behind moved the infantry. The commander in chief stood on the road out of the village, letting the troops pass by him. Kutuzov seemed exhausted and irritable that morning. The infantry going past him halted without any command, apparently because something ahead held them up.

�But tell them, finally, to form into battalions and go around the village,� Kutuzov said angrily to a general who rode up. �Don�t you understand, Your Excellency, my dear sir, that to stretch out in a defile through village streets is impossible when we�re marching against an enemy?�

�I intended to form them up outside the village, Your Excellency,� said the general.

Kutuzov laughed biliously.

�A fine sight you�d be, lining up in view of the enemy, a very fine sight!�

�The enemy�s still far off, Your Excellency. According to the disposition��

�The disposition!� Kutuzov exclaimed biliously. �Who told you that?�Kindly do as you�re ordered.�

�Yes, sir!�

�Mon cher,� Nesvitsky said to Prince Andrei in a whisper, �le vieux est d�une humeur de chien.�

An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes on his hat rode up to Kutuzov and asked on behalf of the emperor whether the fourth column had started into action.

Kutuzov turned away without answering him, and his gaze chanced to rest on Prince Andrei, who was standing close by. Seeing Bolkonsky, Kutuzov softened the angry and caustic expression of his gaze, as if aware that his adjutant was not to blame for what was going on. And, without answering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkonsky:

�Allez voir, mon cher, si la troisi&#232;me division a d&#233;pass&#233; le village. Dites-lui de s�arr&#234;ter et d�attendre mes ordres.�

Prince Andrei had only just started when he stopped him.

�Et demandez-lui si les tirailleurs sont post&#233;s,� he added. �Ce qu�ils font, ce qu�ils font!� he said to himself, still not answering the Austrian.

Prince Andrei galloped off to carry out his mission.

Overtaking all the advancing battalions, he stopped the third division and ascertained that there was in fact no line of riflemen in front of our columns. The regimental commander of the front regiment was very surprised by the order conveyed to him from the commander in chief to send out riflemen. The regimental commander stood there in the full conviction that there were more troops ahead of him, and that the enemy was no less than six miles away. In fact, nothing could be seen ahead but empty terrain sloping away and covered with thick fog. Having ordered on behalf of the commander in chief that the omission be rectified, Prince Andrei galloped back. Kutuzov still stood in the same place and, his corpulent body sagging over the saddle in old man�s fashion, yawned deeply, closing his eyes. The troops were no longer moving, but stood at parade rest.

�Very good, very good,� he said to Prince Andrei and turned to a general who stood there with a watch in his hand, saying it was time to move on, because all the columns of the left flank had already descended.

�We still have time, Your Excellency,� Kutuzov said through a yawn. �We have time!� he repeated.

Just then, from well behind Kutuzov, came shouts of regimental greetings, and these voices began to approach quickly along the whole extended line of the advancing Russian columns. It was clear that the one being greeted was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment Kutuzov was standing in front of began to shout, he rode slightly to one side and, wincing, turned to look. Down the road from Pratz galloped what looked like a squadron of varicolored horsemen. Two of them rode side by side at a great gallop ahead of the rest. One, in a black uniform with white plumes, rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other, in a white uniform, rode a black horse. These were the two emperors with their suite. Kutuzov, with the affectation of a frontline veteran, ordered his standing troops to �attention� and, saluting, rode up to the emperor. His whole figure and manner suddenly changed. He acquired the look of a subordinate, unthinking man. With affected deference, which obviously struck the emperor Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted him.

The unpleasant impression, like the remains of fog in a clear sky, passed over the emperor�s young and happy face and disappeared. He was somewhat thinner that day, after his illness, than on the field of Olm&#252;tz, where Bolkonsky had seen him for the first time abroad, but there was the same enchanting combination of majesty and mildness in his beautiful gray eyes, and the fine lips had the same possibility of various expressions, with a prevalent expression of good-natured, innocent youth.

At the Olm&#252;tz review he was more majestic; here he was more cheerful and energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping two miles and, reining in his horse, gave a sigh of relief and looked around at the faces of his suite, as young, as animated as his own. Czartoryski and Novosiltsev, and Prince Volkonsky and Stroganov, and the others, all richly clad, cheerful young men on splendid, pampered, fresh, only slightly sweaty horses, talking and smiling, stopped behind the sovereign. The emperor Franz, a ruddy, long-faced young man, sat extremely straight on his handsome black stallion and looked around him with a preoccupied, unhurried air. He called up one of his white adjutants and asked something. �Most likely what time they started,� thought Prince Andrei, observing his old aquaintance, and recalling his audience with a smile he was unable to repress. In the emperors� suite there were picked fine young orderly officers, Russian and Austrian, from the guards and infantry regiments. Among them were grooms leading the handsome spare horses of the royalty in embroidered cloths.

As fresh air from the fields suddenly breathes through an open window into a stuffy room, so youth, energy, and certainty of success breathed upon Kutuzov�s cheerless staff as these brilliant young men galloped up.

�Why don�t you begin, Mikhail Larionovich?� the emperor Alexander hurriedly addressed Kutuzov, at the same time glancing courteously at the emperor Franz.

�I am waiting, Your Majesty,� answered Kutuzov, inclining deferentially.

The emperor cupped his ear, frowning slightly and showing that he had not heard properly.

�I�m waiting, Your Majesty,� Kutuzov repeated (Prince Andrei noticed that Kutuzov�s upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said this �waiting�). �Not all the columns are assembled, Your Majesty.�

The sovereign heard, but this reply clearly did not please him; he shrugged his slightly stooping shoulders, glanced at Novosiltsev, who stood nearby, as if complaining of Kutuzov by this glance.

�We�re not on the Tsaritsyn Field, Mikhail Larionovich, where you don�t start a parade until all the regiments are assembled,� said the sovereign, again glancing into the eyes of the emperor Franz, as though inviting him, if not to take part, at least to listen to what he was saying; but the emperor Franz went on looking around and did not listen.

�That is just why I do not begin, Sire,� Kutuzov said in a ringing voice, as if to forestall the possibility of not being heard, and again something twitched in his face. �I do not begin, Sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Tsaritsyn Field,� he uttered clearly and distinctly.

All the faces in the sovereign�s suite instantly exchanged glances with each other, expressing murmur and reproach. �Old as he may be, he should not, he simply should not speak that way,� these faces expressed.

The sovereign looked fixedly and attentively into Kutuzov�s eyes, waiting to see if he would say something more. But Kutuzov, for his part, bowed his head deferentially and also seemed to be waiting. The silence lasted for about a minute.

�However, if you order it, Your Majesty,� said Kutuzov, raising his head and again changing his tone to that of a dull, unthinking, but obedient general.

He touched up his horse and, calling to him the column leader Miloradovich, gave him the order to advance.

The troops stirred again, and two battalions of the Novgorodsky regiment and a battalion of the Apsheronsky regiment moved on past the sovereign.

While this Apsheronsky battalion was marching by, ruddy-faced Miloradovich, with no greatcoat, in his uniform tunic and decorations and a hat with enormous plumes, worn at an angle and brim first, galloped ahead hup-two, and with a dashing salute, reined in his horse before the sovereign.

�God be with you, General,� said the sovereign.

�Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce que qui sera dans notre possibilit&#233;, sire!� he replied merrily, nevertheless calling up mocking smiles among the gentlemen of the suite with his bad French.

Miloradovich turned his horse sharply and placed himself slightly behind the sovereign. The Apsherontsy, excited by the presence of the sovereign, marched past the emperors and their suite at a dashingly brisk pace, beating their feet.

�Lads!� cried Miloradovich in a loud, self-assured, and merry voice, obviously so excited by the sounds of gunfire, the anticipation of battle, and the sight of his gallant Apsherontsy�his companions from Suvorov�s time�marching briskly past the emperors, that he forgot the sovereign�s presence. �Lads, it won�t be the first village you�ve taken!� he shouted.

�We do our best, sir!� the soldiers shouted out.

The sovereign�s horse shied at the sudden shout. This horse, who had carried the sovereign at reviews while still in Russia, also carried her rider here, on the field of Austerlitz, enduring the distracted nudges of his left foot, pricked up her ears at the sound of gunshots just as she did on the Field of Mars, understanding neither the meaning of the shots she heard, nor the presence of the emperor Franz�s black stallion, nor anything of what her rider said, thought, or felt that day.

The sovereign turned with a smile to one of his retinue, pointing to the gallant Apsherontsy, and said something to him.


XVI

Kutuzov, accompanied by his adjutants, rode at a walk behind the carabineers.

Having gone less than half a mile at the tail of the column, he stopped by a solitary, deserted house (probably a former tavern), where the road forked. Both roads went down the hill, and troops were marching along both.

The fog began to lift, and enemy troops could be dimly seen about a mile and a half away on the heights opposite. To the left below, the gunfire was growing louder. Kutuzov stopped, talking with an Austrian general. Prince Andrei, standing slightly behind him, peered at the enemy and turned to an adjutant, wishing to borrow a field glass from him.

�Look, look,� said this adjutant, looking not at the distant troops, but down the hill in front of him. �It�s the French!�

The two generals and the adjutants began snatching at the field glass, pulling it away from each other. All their faces suddenly changed, and on all of them horror appeared. The French were supposed to be a mile and a half from us, and they suddenly turned up right in front of us.

�Is it the enemy?�No!�Yes, look, he�s�for certain�What is this?� voices said.

With his naked eye, Prince Andrei saw below, to the right, a dense column of French coming up to meet the Apsherontsy, no further than five hundred paces from where Kutuzov was standing.

�Here it is, the decisive moment has come! Now it�s my turn,� thought Prince Andrei, and, spurring his horse, he rode up to Kutuzov.

�The Apsherontsy must be stopped, Your Excellency!� he cried.

But at that same moment everything became covered with smoke, there was the sound of gunfire nearby, and a na&#239;vely frightened voice two steps from Prince Andrei cried: �Well, brothers, that�s it for us!� And it was as if this voice was a command. At this voice everyone began to run.

Confused, ever increasing crowds came running back to the place where, five minutes before, the troops had marched past the emperors. Not only was it difficult to stop this crowd, but it was impossible not to yield and move back with it. Bolkonsky tried only not to be separated from Kutuzov and looked around in perplexity, unable to understand what was happening in front of him. Nesvitsky, looking angry, red, and not like himself, shouted to Kutuzov that if he did not leave at once, he would certainly be taken prisoner. Kutuzov stood in the same place and, without responding, took out his handkerchief. Blood was flowing from his cheek. Prince Andrei forced his way to him.

�Are you wounded?� he asked, barely able to control the trembling of his lower jaw.

�The wound isn�t here, it�s there!� said Kutuzov, pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing men.

�Stop them!� he cried, and at the same time, probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.

A fresh crowd of fleeing men streamed past, caught him up, and carried him backwards.

The troops were fleeing in such a dense crowd that, once one landed in the middle of it, it was difficult to get out. Someone shouted, �Keep going, don�t drag your feet!� Another, turning around, fired into the air; someone else struck the horse on which Kutuzov himself was riding. Extricating themselves with the greatest effort from the flow of the crowd to the left, Kutuzov and his suite, diminished by more than half, rode towards the sounds of nearby cannon fire. Extricating himself from the crowd of fleeing men, Prince Andrei, trying to keep up with Kutuzov, saw on the slope of the hill, amidst the smoke, a Russian battery still firing, and the French running up to it. Slightly higher stood Russian infantry, neither moving ahead to aid the battery, nor backwards in the direction of the fugitives. A general on horseback separated himself from the infantry and rode up to Kutuzov. There were only four men left in Kutuzov�s suite. They were all pale and exchanged glances silently.

�Stop those villains!� Kutuzov said breathlessly to the regimental commander, pointing to the fleeing men; but at the same moment, as if in punishment for those words, bullets, like a flock of birds, flew whistling at the regiment and Kutuzov�s suite.

The French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutuzov, were shooting at him. With this volley, the regimental commander seized his leg; several soldiers fell, and an ensign holding a standard let it drop from his hands; the standard wavered and fell, stopped momentarily by the bayonets of the soldiers around it. The soldiers began firing without any orders.

�Oooh!� Kutuzov moaned with an expression of despair and looked around. �Bolkonsky,� he whispered in a voice trembling with awareness of his old man�s strengthlessness. �Bolkonsky,� he whispered, pointing to the disordered battalion and the enemy, �what�s going on?�

But before he finished saying it, Prince Andrei, feeling sobs of shame and anger rising in his throat, was already jumping off his horse and running towards the standard.

�Forward, lads!� he cried in a childishly shrill voice.

�Here it is!� thought Prince Andrei, seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with delight the whistle of bullets, evidently aimed precisely at him. Several soldiers fell.

�Hurrah!� cried Prince Andrei, barely able to hold up the heavy standard, and he ran forward with unquestioning assurance that the entire battalion would run after him.

And indeed he ran only a few steps alone. One soldier started out, another, and the whole battalion, with a shout of �Hurrah!� rushed forward and overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up, took the standard that was wavering in Prince Andrei�s hands because of its weight, but was killed at once. Prince Andrei again seized the standard and, dragging it by the staff, ran with the battalion. Ahead of him he saw our artillerists, some of whom were fighting, while others abandoned the cannon and came running in his direction; he also saw French infantrymen, who had seized the artillery horses and were turning the cannon. Prince Andrei and his battalion were now twenty paces from the cannon. Above him he heard the unceasing whistle of bullets, and soldiers ceaselessly gasped and fell to right and left of him. But he did not look at them; he looked fixedly only at what was happening ahead of him�at the battery. He clearly saw the figure of a red-haired gunner, his shako knocked askew, pulling a swab from one side, while a French soldier pulled it towards him from the other side. Prince Andrei saw clearly the bewildered and at the same time angry expression on the faces of the two men, who evidently did not understand what they were doing.

�What are they doing?� Prince Andrei wondered, looking at them. �Why doesn�t the red-haired artillerist run away, since he has no weapon? Why doesn�t the Frenchman stab him? Before he runs away, the Frenchman will remember his musket and bayonet him.�

In fact, another Frenchman with his musket atilt ran up to the fighting men, and the lot of the red-haired artillerist, who still did not understand what awaited him and triumphantly pulled the swab from the French soldier�s hands, was about to be decided. But Prince Andrei did not see how it ended. It seemed to him as though one of the nearest soldiers, with the full swing of a stout stick, hit him on the head. It was slightly painful and above all unpleasant, because the pain distracted him and kept him from seeing what he had been looking at.

�What is it? am I falling? are my legs giving way under me?� he thought, and fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the fight between the French and the artillerists ended, and wishing to know whether or not the red-haired artillerist had been killed, whether the cannon had been taken or saved. But he did not see anything. There was nothing over him now except the sky�the lofty sky, not clear, but still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds slowly creeping across it. �How quiet, calm, and solemn, not at all like when I was running,� thought Prince Andrei, �not like when we were running, shouting, and fighting; not at all like when the Frenchman and the artillerist, with angry and frightened faces, were pulling at the swab�it�s quite different the way the clouds creep across this lofty, infinite sky. How is it I haven�t seen this lofty sky before? And how happy I am that I�ve finally come to know it. Yes! everything is empty, everything is a deception, except this infinite sky. There is nothing, nothing except that. But there is not even that, there is nothing except silence, tranquillity. And thank God!��


XVII

At nine o�clock, the action had not yet begun for Bagration on the right flank. Not wishing to agree to Dolgorukov�s request to begin action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself, Prince Bagration suggested to Dolgorukov that he send to ask the commander in chief. Bagration knew that, with a stretch of nearly six miles separating one flank from the other, if the messenger was not killed (which was very probable), and even if he found the commander in chief, which would be quite difficult, he would not come back before evening.

Bagration looked over his suite with his big, expressionless, sleepy eyes, and Rostov�s childlike face, involuntarily transfixed with excitement and hope, was the first thing that struck his eye. He sent him.

�And if I should meet His Majesty before the commander in chief, Your Excellency?� asked Rostov, holding his hand to his visor.

�You can give the message to His Majesty,� said Dolgorukov, hastily cutting off Bagration.

After being relieved from the picket line, Rostov had managed to sleep for a few hours before morning, and he felt cheerful, bold, resolute, with that suppleness of movement, assurance of his good luck, and in that state of mind in which everything seems easy, cheerful, and possible.

All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: general battle was to be given, he was to take part in it; moreover, he was an orderly officer of the bravest of generals; moreover, he was going with a message to Kutuzov and maybe to the sovereign himself. The morning was bright, the horse under him was good. He felt joyful and happy. On receiving the order, he started his horse and rode along the line. First he rode along the line of Bagration�s troops, who had not yet gone into action and stood motionless; then he rode into the space occupied by Uvarov�s cavalry, and here he noticed movement and signs of preparation for action; having passed Uvarov�s cavalry, he clearly heard the sounds of cannon and gunfire ahead of him. The fire kept intensifying.

In the fresh morning air, the shooting was no longer as before�at irregular intervals, two or three gunshots, then one or two cannon shots�now on the slopes of the hills before Pratz one could hear rolling salvos of musket fire, interrupted by such rapid cannon fire that at times the separate shots could not be distinguished from each other, but merged into a general roar.

One could see the puffs of gunsmoke as if running and chasing each other on the slopes, and the smoke of the cannon swirling, spreading, and merging together. One could see, from the gleam of bayonets amidst the smoke, the moving masses of infantry and the narrow strips of artillery with green caissons.

Rostov stopped his horse for a minute on a knoll, so as to see what was going on; but no matter how he strained his attention, he could neither understand nor make out what was going on: some sort of men were moving about in the smoke; some sort of sheets of troops were moving in front and behind; but why? who? where?�it was impossible to grasp. The sights and sounds not only did not arouse any sort of dejected or timid feelings in him, but, on the contrary, gave him energy and determination.

�More, more, step it up!� he addressed these sounds mentally, and again started riding along the line, penetrating further and further into the area of the troops already going into action.

�How it�s going to be, I don�t know, but all will be well!� thought Rostov.

Having ridden past some Austrian troops, Rostov noticed that the next part of the line (this was the guards) had already gone into action.

�So much the better! I�ll see it close-up,� he thought.

He was riding almost along the front line. Several horsemen came riding in his direction. They were our life uhlans, who were returning from an attack in disorderly ranks. Rostov passed by them, involuntarily noticing that one of them was covered with blood, and rode on.

�It�s none of my business!� he thought. He had not managed to go a few hundred paces after that when to the left of him, cutting across, there appeared along the whole width of the field an enormous mass of cavalrymen on black horses, in white gleaming uniforms, coming straight at him at a canter. Rostov sent his horse into a full gallop to get out of the way of these cavalrymen, and he would have gotten away from them if they had continued at the same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the horses were already galloping. Rostov heard their hoofbeats and the clanging of their weapons growing louder and louder, and saw their horses, their figures, and even their faces more and more clearly. These were our horse guards going into attack against the French cavalry, which was coming towards them.

The horse guards galloped, but still holding back their horses. Rostov could now see their faces and heard the command �Forward, forward!� uttered by an officer, letting his thoroughbred go at full speed. Rostov, afraid of being trampled or swept into the attack on the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, and still did not manage to avoid them.

The last horse guard, a pockmarked man of enormous height, frowned angrily, seeing Rostov in front of him, where he would inevitably run into him. This horse guard would certainly have knocked Rostov and his Bedouin down (Rostov felt himself so small and weak compared to these enormous men and horses), if it had not occurred to him to swing his whip at the eyes of the guardsman�s horse. The heavy, black, twenty-hand horse shied, laying back his ears; but the pockmarked horse guard spurred him as hard as he could with his huge spurs, and the horse, tossing his tail and stretching his neck, raced on still faster. The horse guards had barely gone past Rostov, when he heard their shout of �Hurrah!� and, turning, saw their front ranks mingling with other, probably French, horsemen with red epaulettes. Beyond that nothing could be seen, because just after that cannon began firing from somewhere and everything was covered in smoke.

At the moment when the horse guards, going past him, disappeared into the smoke, Rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or ride where he was supposed to. This was that brilliant attack of the horse guards which astonished the French themselves. Rostov was horrified to hear later that, of all that mass of enormous, handsome men, of all those brilliant, rich men, youths, officers, and junkers, who had ridden past him on thousand-rouble horses, only eighteen were left after the attack.

�Why should I envy them, mine won�t go away, and now maybe I�ll see the sovereign!� thought Rostov, and he rode on.

Having drawn even with the infantry guards, he noticed that cannonballs were flying over and around them, not so much because he heard the sound of the cannon, but because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers� faces, and on the officers� an unnatural military solemnity.

Riding behind one of the lines of the infantry guard regiments, he heard a voice call him by name.

�Rostov!�

�What?� he replied, not recognizing Boris.

�Imagine, we got into the front line! Our regiment went into an attack!� said Boris, smiling that happy smile which occurs in young men who have been under fire for the first time.

Rostov stopped.

�Really!� he said. �And what then?�

�We beat them back,� Boris said animatedly, becoming talkative. �Can you imagine?�

And Boris began telling how the guards, taking up their position and seeing troops in front of them, took them for Austrians, and suddenly, from the cannonballs fired from those troops, realized that they were in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action. Rostov, not hearing Boris out, touched up his horse.

�Where are you going?� asked Boris.

�To his majesty with a message.�

�There he is!� said Boris, who thought he heard Rostov say �his highness� instead of �his majesty.�

And he pointed him to the grand duke, who, a hundred paces from them, in a helmet and a horse guard�s tunic, with his raised shoulders and frowning brows, was shouting something to a white and pale-faced Austrian officer.

�But that�s the grand duke, and I need the commander in chief or the sovereign,� said Rostov, and he touched up his horse.

�Count, Count!� cried Berg, as animated as Boris, running up to him from the other side. �Count, I�m wounded in the right hand,� he said, showing his hand, bloody and bandaged with a handkerchief, �and I stayed in the line. I hold the sword in my left hand, Count: our race, the von Bergs, Count, were all knights.�

Berg was still saying something, but Rostov did not listen any further and rode on.

Having gone past the guards and an empty space, Rostov, to avoid getting into the front line again, as he had during the attack of the horse guards, followed the line of the reserves, making a wide circle around the place where the hottest shooting and cannon fire were heard. Suddenly, ahead of him and behind our troops, in a place where he could never have supposed the enemy to be, he heard nearby musket fire.

�What can that be?� thought Rostov. �The enemy in the rear of our troops? It can�t be,� thought Rostov, and the terror of fear for himself and for the outcome of the whole battle suddenly came over him. �Whatever it may be, however,� he thought, �there�s no point now in going around. I must look for the commander in chief here, and if all is lost, then it�s my business to perish along with everybody.�

The bad presentiment that suddenly came over Rostov was confirmed more and more the further he rode into the space beyond the village of Pratz, occupied by crowds of different troops.

�What is this? What is this? Who�s being shot at? Who�s shooting?� asked Rostov, drawing even with Russian and Austrian soldiers running in mixed crowds across his path.

�Devil knows about them! He�s beaten everybody! Perish them all!� answers came in Russian, German, and Czech from the crowds of fleeing men who, like himself, did not understand what was going on there.

�Shoot the Germans!� cried one.

�Devil take them�the traitors!�

�Zum Henker diese Russen!�� a German grumbled.

Several wounded soldiers were walking down the road. Oaths, shouts, groans merged into one general clamor. The shooting died down, and, as Rostov learned later, it had been Russian and Austrian soldiers shooting at each other.

�My God! What is it?� thought Rostov. �Here, where the sovereign may see them at any moment!�But no, it must be just a few scoundrels. It will pass, that�s not it, it can�t be,� he thought. �Just ride past them quickly, quickly!�

The thought of defeat and flight could not enter Rostov�s head. Though he saw French guns and troops precisely on the Pratzen heights, in the very place where he had been told to look for the commander in chief, he could not and would not believe it.


XVIII

Rostov had been told to look for Kutuzov and the sovereign near the village of Pratz. But not only were they not there, but there was not a single superior officer, there were only various crowds of disorderly troops. He urged on his already tired horse so as to get quickly past these crowds, but the further he went, the more disorderly the crowds became. The high road he came out on was crowded with carriages, vehicles of all kinds, Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, wounded and not wounded. All this droned and swarmed confusedly, under the grim sound of cannonballs flying from the French batteries set up on the Pratzen heights.

�Where is the sovereign? Where is Kutuzov?� Rostov asked everyone he could stop, and he got no answer from any of them.

At last, seizing a soldier by the collar, he made him answer.

�Eh, brother! They all ran off ahead there long ago!� the soldier said to Rostov, laughing at something and trying to free himself.

Abandoning that soldier, who was obviously drunk, Rostov stopped the horse of an orderly or groom of some important person and began questioning him. The orderly announced to Rostov that the sovereign had been driven away at top speed in a carriage an hour earlier and that he was dangerously wounded.

�It can�t be,� said Rostov, �it must have been somebody else.�

�I saw him myself,� said the orderly with a self-assured grin. �I ought to know the sovereign by now: seems I saw him lots of times in Petersburg this close. He was sitting in the carriage pale as can be. Four black horses, saints alive, how they went rattling past us: seems I ought to know the tsar�s horses and Ilya Ivanych by now; seems Ilya the coachman drives nobody but the tsar.�

Rostov let go of his horse and wanted to ride on. Passing by, a wounded officer addressed him.

�Who do you want?� asked the officer. �The commander in chief? He was killed by a cannonball, hit in the chest in front of our regiment.�

�Not killed, wounded,� another officer corrected.

�Who? Kutuzov?� asked Rostov.

�Not Kutuzov, but what�s his name�well, it makes no difference, there weren�t many left alive. Go over there, to that village, all the superiors are assembled there,� said this officer, pointing to the village of Hostieradek, and he passed by.

Rostov rode at a walk, not knowing why and to whom he was going now. The sovereign was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible not to believe it now. Rostov rode in the direction indicated to him and in which he could see a tower and a church in the distance. Why should he hurry? What was he to say now to the sovereign or to Kutuzov, even if they were alive and not wounded?

�Go that way, Your Honor, here you�ll get killed straight off,� a soldier cried to him. �Killed straight off!�

�Ah! What are you saying!� said another. �Where are you sending him? This way�s closer.�

Rostov pondered and went precisely in the direction in which he was told he would be killed.

�It makes no difference now! If even the sovereign is wounded, why should I look out for myself?� he thought. He rode into that space in which the most men fleeing from Pratz had been killed. The French had not yet taken this space, but the Russians�those who were alive or wounded�had abandoned it long ago. Over the field, like sheaves on good wheatland, lay dead or wounded men, ten to fifteen to an acre. The wounded crept together by twos and threes, and one could hear their unpleasant cries and moans, sometimes feigned, as it seemed to Rostov. He sent his horse into a canter, so as not to see all these suffering men, and he felt frightened. He was afraid, not for his life, but for the courage he needed and which, he knew, could not bear the sight of these wretches.

The French, who had stopped firing on this field strewn with dead and wounded because there was nothing left alive on it, seeing an adjutant riding across it, aimed a cannon and fired several shots. The sensation of these whistling, fearsome sounds and the surrounding dead merged for Rostov into a single impression of terror and pity for himself. He recalled his mother�s last letter. �What would she feel,� he wondered, �if she saw me here now, on this field, with cannon aimed at me?�

In the village of Hostieradek, he found Russian troops, confused, but heading away from the battlefield in greater order. The French cannon fire did not carry that far, and the sounds of shooting seemed a long way off. Here everyone already clearly saw and said that the battle was lost. No matter who Rostov turned to, no one could tell him where the sovereign was, or where Kutuzov was. Some said that the rumor of the sovereign�s wound was correct, others said it was not and explained the spread of this false rumor by the fact that the grand marshal of the court, Count Tolstoy, who had ridden to the battlefield with others in the emperor�s suite, had indeed galloped away from the battlefield, pale and frightened, in the sovereign�s carriage. One officer told Rostov that he had seen someone from the high command to the left beyond the village, and Rostov went there, no longer hoping to find anyone, but only to keep his own conscience clear. Having ridden two miles and left behind the last of the Russian troops, Rostov saw two horsemen standing near a kitchen garden surrounded by a ditch. They were facing this ditch. One, with white plumes on his hat, seemed familiar to Rostov for some reason; the other, an unfamiliar horseman on a beautiful chestnut horse (the horse seemed familiar to Rostov), rode up to the ditch, spurred his horse and, releasing the reins, lightly jumped over the garden ditch. Only a little soil crumbled down the bank from the horse�s hind hoofs. Turning his horse sharply, he leaped back over the ditch and courteously addressed the horseman with the white plumage, evidently suggesting that he do the same. The horseman whose figure seemed familiar to Rostov and for some reason involuntarily riveted his attention, made a negative gesture with his head and hand, and by this gesture Rostov instantly recognized his lamented, adored sovereign.

�But that can�t be him, alone in the middle of this empty field,� thought Rostov. Just then Alexander turned his head, and Rostov saw the beloved features so vividly imprinted on his memory. The sovereign was pale, his cheeks were hollow, his eyes sunken; but there was all the more loveliness and mildness in his features. Rostov was happy now to be assured that the rumor of the sovereign�s wound was incorrect. He was happy to see him. He knew that he could, even must, address him directly and convey to him what Dolgorukov had ordered him to convey.

But as a young man in love trembles and thrills, not daring to utter what he dreams of by night, and looks about fearfully, seeking help or the possibility of delay and flight, when the desired moment comes and he stands alone with her, so now Rostov, having attained what he desired more than anything in the world, did not know how to approach the sovereign and presented thousands of considerations to himself for why it was unsuitable, improper, and impossible.

�What! It�s as if I was glad to take advantage of his being alone and dejected. It may be unpleasant and difficult for him to meet an unknown person at this moment of sorrow, and then, what can I say to him now, when at the mere sight of him my heart stops and my mouth goes dry?� Not one of the countless speeches to the sovereign that he had composed in his imagination came to his head now. Those speeches were for the most part held under quite different conditions; they were spoken for the most part in moments of victory and triumph, and predominantly on his deathbed from the wounds he had received, while the sovereign thanked him for his heroic deeds, and he, dying, voiced the love confirmed by his acts.

�And then, what am I to ask the sovereign about his orders for the right flank, when it is now past three in the afternoon and the battle is lost? No, decidedly, I should not approach him, should not disturb his thoughts. Better to die a thousand times than to get a bad look or a bad opinion from him,� Rostov decided and rode away with sorrow and despair in his heart, constantly turning to look at the sovereign, still standing in the same attitude of indecision.

While Rostov was making these considerations and sorrowfully riding away from the sovereign, Captain von Toll happened to arrive in the same place and, seeing the sovereign, rode straight up to him, offered him his services, and helped him to cross the ditch on foot. The sovereign, wishing to rest and feeling unwell, sat down under an apple tree, and Toll stopped beside him. Rostov, from a distance, with envy and regret, saw von Toll say something to the sovereign at length and with ardor, and saw the sovereign, probably weeping, cover his eyes with his hand and press Toll�s hand.

�And I could be in his place!� Rostov thought to himself and, barely holding back tears of pity over the sovereign�s fate, rode on in complete despair, not knowing where he was going now or why.

His despair was the stronger in that he felt his own weakness was the cause of his grief.

He could�not only could, but should have ridden up to the sovereign. And that was a unique chance to show the sovereign his devotion. And he had not made use of it��What have I done?� he thought. And he turned his horse and rode back to the place where he had seen the emperor; but there was no one now on the other side of the ditch. Only wagons and carriages drove along. From one cart driver he learned that Kutuzov�s staff was in a nearby village, where the train was going. Rostov followed them.

Ahead of him walked Kutuzov�s groom, leading horses covered with cloths. Behind the groom came a wagon, and behind the wagon an old house serf in a peaked cap, a short coat, and with bandy legs.

�Titus, hey, Titus!� said the groom.

�What?� the old man asked distractedly.

�Titus! Don�t bite us!�

�Eh, you fool! Pah!� the old man said and spat angrily. Some time passed in silent movement, and the same joke was repeated again.





By five o�clock in the afternoon, the battle had been lost at all points. More than a hundred cannon had already been captured by the French.

Przebyszewski and his corps laid down their arms. Other columns, having lost about half their men, were retreating in disorderly, confused crowds.

The remains of Langeron�s and Dokhturov�s troops, mixed together, crowded around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of Augesd.

After five o�clock it was only at the dam of Augesd that the hot cannon fire of the French alone could be heard, from numerous batteries lined up on the slopes of the Pratzen heights and firing at our retreating troops.

In the rear guard, Dokhturov and others, drawing up some battalions, fired back at the French cavalry who were pursuing our troops. It was beginning to get dark. On the narrow dam of Augesd, on which for so many years an old miller in a cap used to sit peacefully with his fishing rods, while his grandson, his shirtsleeves rolled up, fingered the silvery, trembling fish in the watering can; on this dam over which, for so many years, Moravians in shaggy hats and blue jackets had peacefully driven in their two-horse carts laden with wheat and had driven back over the same dam all dusty with flour, their carts white�now, on this narrow dam, between wagons and cannon, under horses and between wheels, crowded men disfigured by the fear of death, crushing each other, dying, stepping over the dying, and killing each other, only to go a few steps and be killed themselves just the same.

Every ten seconds, pushing through the air, a cannonball smacked or a shell exploded in the midst of this dense crowd, killing and spattering with blood those who stood near. Dolokhov, wounded in the arm, on foot, with a dozen soldiers of his company (he was already an officer), and his regimental commander, on horseback, represented the remainder of the entire regiment. Drawn by the crowd, they pressed into the entrance to the dam and, hemmed in on all sides, stopped, because ahead of them a horse had fallen under a cannon and the crowd was pulling it out. One cannonball killed someone behind them, another landed in front and spattered Dolokhov with blood. The crowd pushed on desperately, shrank back, went a few steps, and stopped again.

�Get through these hundred steps and I�m saved for sure; stand here another two minutes and I�m sure to be dead,� each man was thinking.

Dolokhov, who was standing in the middle of the crowd, tore his way to the edge of the dam, knocking two soldiers off their feet, and ran down onto the slippery ice that covered the pond.

�Turn off!� he cried, skipping over the ice, which cracked under him; �turn off!� he cried to the ordnance. �It holds!��

The ice held him, but it sagged and cracked, and it was obvious that it would give way, not only under a cannon or a crowd, but under him alone. People looked at him and pressed to the bank, not yet daring to step onto the ice. The regimental commander, standing on horseback at the entrance, raised his arm and opened his mouth, addressing Dolokhov. Suddenly one of the cannonballs came whistling so low over the crowd that everybody ducked. There was a wet smack, and the general and his horse fell in a pool of blood. No one looked at the general, still less thought of picking him up.

�Go onto the ice! Go onto the ice! Go! Turn off! Don�t you hear? Go!� cried countless voices after the cannonball hit the general, themselves not knowing what and why they were shouting.

One of the rearmost cannon going onto the dam turned off onto the ice. Crowds of soldiers started running down off the dam onto the frozen pond. The ice cracked under one of the foremost soldiers and one foot went into the water; he tried to right himself and fell through to the waist. The nearest soldiers hesitated, the cannon driver stopped his horse, but shouts were still heard from behind: �Go onto the ice, don�t stop, go! go!� And cries of terror were heard in the crowd. The soldiers around the gun waved at the horses and beat them to make them turn and move on. The horses set out from the bank. The ice that had held the foot soldiers gave way in one huge piece, and about forty of them rushed, some back, some forward, drowning each other.

The cannonballs went on regularly whistling and smacking into the ice, into the water, and most often into the crowd that covered the dam, the ponds, and the bank.

On the Pratzen hill, in the same place where he fell with the staff of the standard in his hands, Prince Andrei Bolkonsky lay bleeding profusely and, unbeknownst to himself, letting out soft, pitiful, and childlike moans.

Towards evening he stopped moaning and became completely still. He did not know how long he was unconscious. Suddenly he felt himself alive again and suffering from a burning and rending pain in the head.

�Where is it, that lofty sky, which I never knew till now and saw today?� was his first thought. �And I never knew this suffering either,� he thought. �Yes, I knew nothing, nothing till now. But where am I?�

He began to listen, and heard the sounds of approaching hoofbeats and the sound of voices speaking French. He opened his eyes. Over him again was that same lofty sky with floating clouds rising still higher, through which showed the blue of infinity. He did not turn his head and did not see those who, judging by the sounds of hoofs and voices, had ridden up to him and stopped.

The horsemen who had ridden up were Napoleon accompanied by two adjutants. Bonaparte, riding over the battlefield, had given final orders about the reinforcement of the batteries firing at the dam of Augesd and was looking at the dead and wounded who were left on the battlefield.

�De beaux hommes!� said Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier who, his face buried in the ground and his nape blackened, lay on his stomach, one of his already stiff arms flung far out.

�Les munitions des pi&#232;ces de positions sont &#233;puis&#233;es, sire!� an adjutant said just then, having come from the batteries that were firing on Augesd.

�Faites avancer celles de la r&#233;serve,� said Napoleon, and, riding on a few paces, he stopped over Prince Andrei, who lay on his back, the staff of the standard fallen beside him (the standard had already been taken as a trophy by the French).

�Voil&#224; une belle mort,� said Napoleon, looking at Bolkonsky.

Prince Andrei understood that it had been said about him, and that it was Napoleon speaking. He heard the man who had said these words being addressed as sire. But he heard these words as if he was hearing the buzzing of a fly. He not only was not interested, he did not even notice, and at once forgot them. He had a burning in his head; he felt that he was losing blood, and he saw above him that distant, lofty, and eternal sky. He knew that it was Napoleon�his hero�but at that moment, Napoleon seemed to him such a small, insignificant man compared with what was now happening between his soul and this lofty, infinite sky with clouds racing across it. To him it was all completely the same at that moment who was standing over him or what he said about him; he was only glad that people had stopped over him and only wished that those people would help him and bring him back to life, which seemed so beautiful to him, because he now understood it so differently. He gathered all his strength in order to stir and produce some sound. He stirred his leg weakly and produced a weak, painful moan that moved even him to pity.

�Ah! he�s alive,� said Napoleon. �Lift up this young man, ce jeune homme, and take him to the first-aid station!�

Having said that, Napoleon rode on further to meet Marshal Lannes, who was riding up to the emperor, taking off his hat and congratulating him on the victory.

Prince Andrei remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being put on the stretcher, the jolting while he was being carried, and the probing of his wound at the first-aid station. He came to only at the end of the day, when he, along with other Russian wounded and captured officers, was taken to the hospital. During this transfer, he felt somewhat fresher and could look around and even speak.

The first words he heard when he came to were the words of the French convoy officer, who was saying hurriedly:

�We must stop here. The emperor will ride by now; it will give him pleasure to see all these gentlemen prisoners.�

�There are so many prisoners today, almost the whole Russian army, that he must be bored with it,� said another officer.

�Well, really! This, they say, is the commander of all the emperor Alexander�s guards,� said the first, pointing to a wounded Russian officer in the white uniform of the horse guards.

Bolkonsky recognized Prince Repnin, whom he used to meet in Petersburg society. Next to him stood another wounded officer of the horse guards, a nineteen-year-old boy.

Bonaparte, riding up at a gallop, stopped his horse.

�Who�s the senior man?�

They named the colonel, Prince Repnin.

�Are you the commander of the emperor Alexander�s regiment of horse guards?� asked Napoleon.

�I commanded a squadron,� replied Repnin.

�Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably,� said Napoleon.

�The praise of a great general is a soldier�s best reward,� said Repnin.

�I bestow it on you with pleasure,� said Napoleon. �Who is this young man next to you?�

Prince Repnin named Lieutenant Sukhtelen.

Napoleon looked at him and said, smiling:

�Il est venu bien jeune se frotter &#224; nous.�

�Youth is no impediment to bravery,� Sukhtelen said in a halting voice.

�A fine answer,� said Napoleon. �You�ll go far, young man!�

Prince Andrei, who, to complete the trophy of prisoners, was also brought out before the eyes of the emperor, could not fail to attract his attention. Napoleon evidently remembered seeing him on the battlefield, and, turning to him, used the same appellation of young man, jeune homme, under which Bolkonsky had been imprinted on his memory the first time.

�Et vous, jeune homme? And you, young man?� he addressed him. �How do you feel, mon brave?�

Though five minutes earlier Prince Andrei had been able to say a few words to the soldiers transporting him, now, with his eyes fixed directly on Napoleon, he was silent�To him at that moment all the interests that occupied Napoleon seemed so insignificant, his hero himself seemed so petty to him, with his petty vanity and joy in victory, compared with that lofty, just, and kindly sky, which he had seen and understood, that he was unable to answer him.

Then, too, everything seemed so useless and insignificant compared with that stern and majestic way of thinking called up in him by weakness from loss of blood, suffering, and the expectation of imminent death. Looking into Napoleon�s eyes, Prince Andrei thought about the insignficance of grandeur, about the insignificance of life, the meaning of which no one could understand, and about the still greater insignificance of death, the meaning of which no one among the living could understand or explain.

The emperor, receiving no answer, turned away and, as he rode off, addressed one of the officers:

�Have these gentlemen looked after and taken to my bivouac; have my doctor Larrey examine their wounds. Good-bye, Prince Repnin.� And, touching up his horse, he galloped on.

On his face was the radiance of self-satisfaction and happiness.

The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrei and had taken from him the little golden icon hung on her brother by Princess Marya, seeing the kindness with which the emperor treated the prisoners, hastened to return the icon.

Prince Andrei did not see how or by whom it was put back on him, but suddenly, on his chest over the uniform, a little icon on a fine gold chain turned up.

�It would be good,� thought Prince Andrei, looking at this icon which his sister had hung on him with such feeling and reverence, �it would be good if everything was as clear and simple as it seems to Princess Marya. How good it would be to know where to look for help in this life and what to expect after it, there, beyond the grave! How happy and calm I�d be, if I could say now: Lord, have mercy on me!�But to whom shall I say it? Either it is an indefinable, unfathomable power, which I not only cannot address, but which I cannot express in words�the great all or nothing,� he said to himself, �or it is that God whom Princess Marya has sewn in here, in this amulet? Nothing, nothing is certain, except the insignificance of everything I can comprehend and the grandeur of something incomprehensible but most important!�

The stretchers began to move. At every jolt he again felt unbearable pain; his feverish state worsened, and he became delirious. Those reveries of his father, wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had experienced on the night before the battle, the figure of the little, insignificant Napoleon, and the lofty sky over it all, constituted the main basis for his feverish imaginings.

He imagined a quiet life and peaceful family happiness at Bald Hills. He was already enjoying this happiness, when suddenly little Napoleon appeared with his indifferent, limited gaze, happy in the unhappiness of others, and doubts and torments set in, and only the sky promised tranquillity. Towards morning all his reveries became confused and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconsciousness and oblivion, which, in the opinion of Larrey himself, Napoleon�s doctor, would most likely end in death rather than recovery.

�C�est un sujet nerveux et bilieux,� said Larrey, �il n�en r&#233;chappera pas.�

Prince Andrei, among other hopeless wounded, was handed over to the care of the local inhabitants.

I

At the beginning of 1806, Nikolai Rostov came home on leave. Denisov also went home to Voronezh, and Rostov persuaded him to come with him as far as Moscow and stay in their house. At the next to last posting station, Denisov met a friend, drank three bottles of wine with him, and, despite the bumps of the road, did not wake up all the way, lying on the bottom of the horse-drawn sleigh beside Rostov, who became more and more impatient the closer they came to Moscow.

�Soon now? Soon now? Oh, these unbearable streets, shops, bakeries, street lamps, cabbies!� thought Rostov, when they had already registered their leaves at the city gates and entered Moscow.

�Denisov, we�re here!�he�s asleep,� he said, leaning his whole body forward, as if hoping by this posture to speed up the movement of the sleigh. Denisov did not respond.

�Here�s the intersection where the cabby Zakhar stands; here�s Zakhar, and still the same horse! Here�s the grocery where we used to buy gingerbread. Soon now? Come on!�

�Which house is it?� asked the driver.

�The one at the end, the big one, don�t you see? It�s our house,� said Rostov, �it�s our house! Denisov! Denisov! We�re nearly there.�

Denisov raised his head, cleared his throat, and made no reply.

�Dmitri,� Rostov said to the servant on the box. �Aren�t those lights in our house?�

�Exactly so, sir, and there�s light in your papa�s study.�

�So they�re not in bed yet? Eh? What do you think?�

�See that you don�t forget to take out my new Hungarian jacket for me at once,� Rostov added, feeling his new mustache. �Well, on with you,� he cried to the driver. �Wake up now, Vasya,� he turned to Denisov, who was lowering his head again. �Well, on with you, three roubles for vodka, on with you!� shouted Rostov, when the sleigh was three houses away from their entrance. It seemed to him the horses were not moving. At last the sleigh pulled to the right at the entrance; over his head Rostov saw the familiar cornice with its chipped stucco, the porch, the hitching post. He jumped out of the sleigh while it was still moving and ran into the front hall. The house stood as immobile, unwelcoming, as if it cared nothing for the one who had arrived. There was no one in the hall. �My God! is everything all right?� thought Rostov, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and at once set off running down the hall and up the familiar slanting steps. The same door handle, the dirtiness of which always angered the countess, turned as slackly as ever. One tallow candle was burning in the front room.

Old Mikhailo was sleeping on a trunk. The footman Prokofy, the one who was so strong he could lift a carriage by the back rail, was sitting and plaiting slippers out of cloth trimmings. He glanced at the opening door, and his indifferent, sleepy expression suddenly transformed into a rapturously alarmed one.

�Saints alive! The young count!� he cried, recognizing his young master. �What is this? My dear heart!� And Prokofy, trembling with excitement, rushed for the door to the living room, probably to announce him, but clearly thought again, came back, and pressed himself to the young master�s shoulder.

�Everyone well?� asked Rostov, pulling his arm away.

�Thank God! All of them, thank God! They�ve just finished eating! Let me look at you, Your Excellency!�

�Everything�s quite all right?�

�Thank God! Thank God!�

Rostov, forgetting all about Denisov, not wishing anyone to announce him beforehand, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe to the big, dark reception room. Everything was the same�the same card tables, the same chandelier in its cover; but someone had already seen the young master, and before he reached the drawing room, something flew out of a side door precipitously, like a storm, and embraced and began kissing him. A second, then a third such being sprang from a second, a third door; more embraces, more kisses, more shouts, tears of joy. He could not make out where and who was his papa, who was Natasha, who was Petya. Everybody wept, talked, and kissed him at the same time. Only his mother was not among them�he noticed that.

�And I didn�t know�Nikolushka�Kolya, my friend.�

�Here he is�our boy. So changed! No! Candles! Tea!�

�Give me a kiss!�

�Darling�and me, too.�

Sonya, Natasha, Petya, Anna Mikhailovna, Vera, the old count embraced him; servants and maids filled the room, talking and ah-ing.

Petya clung to his legs.

�And me, too!� he cried.

Natasha pulled him down to her and kissed his face all over, then jumped back and, holding the skirt of his Hungarian jacket, hopped up and down in one place like a little goat and shrieked piercingly.

On all sides there were loving eyes, glistening with tears of joy, there were lips that wanted to kiss him.

Sonya, bright red, also held him by the hand, all beaming in the blissful gaze she directed at his eyes, which she had been waiting for. Sonya had already turned sixteen, and she was very beautiful, especially in this moment of happy, rapturous animation. She looked at him, not taking her eyes away, smiling and holding her breath. He glanced at her gratefully, but was still waiting and looking for someone. The old countess had not come out yet. And then footsteps were heard at the door. The footsteps were so quick that they could not have been his mother�s.

But it was she, in a new dress, unfamiliar to him, which must have been made in his absence. Everyone let him go, and he ran to her. When they came together, she fell on his breast, weeping. She could not lift her face, and only pressed it to the cold cords of his Hungarian jacket. Denisov, unnoticed by anyone, came into the room, stood there, and rubbed his eyes looking at them.

�Vassily Denisov, friend of your son,� he said, introducing himself to the old count, who was looking at him questioningly.

�I bid you welcome. I know, I know,� said the count, kissing and embracing Denisov. �Nikolushka wrote to us�Natasha, Vera, here�s Denisov.�

The same happy, rapturous faces turned to Denisov�s shaggy little figure with its black mustaches and surrounded him.

�Darling Denisov!� shrieked Natasha, beside herself with rapture, and she ran to him, embraced and kissed him. Everyone was embarrassed by Natasha�s behavior. Denisov also blushed, but smiled, and, taking Natasha�s hand, kissed it.

Denisov was taken to the room prepared for him, and all the Rostovs gathered in the sitting room around Nikolushka.

The old countess, never letting go of his hand, which she kissed every other moment, sat next to him; the rest clustered around them, catching his every movement, word, gaze, and not taking their rapturously loving eyes off him. His brother and sisters argued, and snatched the places nearest to him from each other, and fought over who was going to bring him tea, a handkerchief, a pipe.

Rostov was very happy in the love that was shown him, but the first moment of their meeting had been so blissful that his present happiness seemed too little to him, and he kept waiting for more, and more, and more.

The next morning the new arrivals slept till past nine.

In the adjoining room, sabers, bags, pouches, open suitcases, dirty boots lay about. Two pairs of polished boots with spurs had just been put near the wall. The servants brought washbasins and hot water for shaving, and brushed their clothes. There was a smell of tobacco and men.

�Hey, Rishka, my pipe!� cried Vaska Denisov�s hoarse voice. �Get up, Rostov!�

Rostov, rubbing his glued-together eyes, raised his disheveled head from the hot pillow.

�What, is it late?�

�Yes. It�s past nine,� Natasha�s voice replied, and in the next room the rustle of starched skirts, whispers, and the laughter of girls� voices were heard, and through the slightly open door flashed something light blue, ribbons, dark hair, and merry faces. This was Natasha, with Sonya and Petya, who had come to see whether he had gotten up.

�Nikolenka, get up!� Natasha�s voice was again heard at the door.

�Right away!�

Just then Petya, glimpsing the sabers in the adjoining room, and seizing them with the feeling of rapture which boys experience at the sight of a military older brother, and forgetting that it was improper for his sisters to see undressed men, opened the door.

�Is this your saber?� he shouted. The girls jumped away. Denisov, with frightened eyes, hid his shaggy legs under the blanket, glancing at his friend for help. The door admitted Petya and closed again. Behind the door there was laughter.

�Nikolenka, come out in your dressing gown,� said Natasha�s voice.

�Is this your saber?� asked Petya. �Or is it yours?� he turned to the mustached, black Denisov with obsequious respect.

Rostov hastily put on his shoes, his dressing gown, and went out. Natasha had put on one spurred boot and was getting into the other. Sonya was twirling and was just about to balloon her dress and crouch down when he came in. The two girls, in identical new light blue dresses, were fresh, red-cheeked, merry. Sonya ran away, but Natasha, taking her brother under the arm, led him to the sitting room, and started talking with him. They hastened to ask and answer each other about a thousand little things that could interest only them. Natasha laughed at every word he said and she said�not because what they were saying was funny, but because she felt merry and was unable to hold back her joy, which expressed itself in laughter.

�Ah, how good, excellent!� she added after every word. Rostov felt how his face and soul expanded under the influence of these hot rays of Natasha�s love, for the first time in a year and a half, into that childish and pure smile which he had not once smiled since he left home.

�No, listen,� she said, �you�re quite a man now. I�m terribly glad you�re my brother.� She touched his mustache. �I�d like to know how you men are. Are you like us?�

�No. Why did Sonya run away?� Rostov asked.

�Ah, that�s a whole other story! How are you going to address Sonya, as �Miss� or not?�

�However it happens,� said Rostov.

�Address her as �Miss,� please, I�ll tell you later.�

�But what?�

�Well, then I�ll tell you now. You know that Sonya�s my friend, such a friend that I�d burn my arm for her. Look here.� She pushed up her muslin sleeve and showed a red mark on her long, thin, and delicate arm, below the shoulder but far above the elbow (where it is covered even by ball gowns).

�I burned it to show her my love. I just heated a ruler in the fire and pressed it there.�

Sitting in his former schoolroom, on the sofa with padded armrests, and looking into Natasha�s desperately lively eyes, Rostov again entered that world of his family and childhood, which had no meaning for anyone but him, but which had provided him with one of the best enjoyments in life; and the burning of the arm with a ruler to show love did not seem nonsense to him; he understood and was not surprised at it.

�So what, then?� he merely asked.

�Well, we�re such friends, such friends! This is just silliness�the ruler; but we�re friends forever. If she loves someone, it�s forever. I don�t understand it. I forget at once.�

�Well, so what?�

�Well, so she loves me and you.� Natasha suddenly blushed. �Well, you remember, before you left�So she says you should forget it all�She said: �I�ll always love him, but let him be free.� That�s excellent, excellent and noble, isn�t it? Right, right? very noble? right?� Natasha asked so earnestly and excitedly that it was clear that what she was saying now, she had said before through tears. Rostov pondered.

�I don�t take back my word in anything,� he said. �And besides, Sonya is so lovely�what fool would renounce his happiness?�

�No, no,� cried Natasha. �She and I already talked about it. We knew you�d say that. But it�s impossible, because, you see, if you say that�if you consider yourself bound by your word, it comes out as if she�d said it on purpose. It comes out as if you�re forced to marry her, and doesn�t come out right at all.�

Rostov saw that they had thought it out very well. Sonya had already struck him with her beauty yesterday. Today, having glimpsed her fleetingly, he thought her better still. She was a lovely sixteen-year-old girl, obviously passionately in love with him (he did not doubt it for a moment). Why shouldn�t he love her and even marry her? thought Rostov; but not now. Now there were so many other joys and things to do! �Yes, they�ve thought it out splendidly,� he thought. �I should remain free.�

�Well, that�s splendid,� he said, �we�ll talk later. Ah, I�m so glad to see you!� he added. �Well, and what about you, you haven�t betrayed Boris?� asked her brother.

�What silliness!� cried Natasha, laughing. �I don�t want to think or know about him or anybody else.�

�Well, now! So what�s with you?�

�Me?� Natasha repeated, and a happy smile lit up her face. �Have you seen Duport?�

�No.�

�The famous Duport, the ballet master�you haven�t seen him? Then you won�t understand. Here�s what I am.� Natasha rounded her arms, took up her skirt as if to dance, ran a few steps, turned, made an entrechat, tapped her foot against her ankle, and went a few steps on the very tips of her toes. �See me standing? So there!� she said; but she could not hold it. �That�s what I am! I�ll never marry anyone, I�ll become a dancer. Only don�t tell anybody.�

Rostov laughed so loudly and merrily that Denisov felt envious in his room, and Natasha, unable to help herself, laughed with him. �No, but it�s nice, isn�t it?� she kept saying.

�Very nice. So you no longer want to marry Boris?�

Natasha blushed.

�I don�t want to marry anybody. I�ll tell him the same when I see him.�

�Well, now!� said Rostov.

�Oh, yes, that�s all trifles,� Natasha went on babbling. �And what, is Denisov nice?� she asked.

�Yes.�

�Well, good-bye, go get dressed. Is he scary, Denisov?�

�Why scary?� asked Nicolas. �No, Vaska�s a sweet man.�

�You call him Vaska?�Strange. And what, is he very nice?�

�Very nice.�

�Well, come quickly and have tea. All of us together.�

And Natasha got up on tiptoe and walked out of the room as ballet dancers do, but smiling as only happy fifteen-year-old girls do. Meeting Sonya in the drawing room, Rostov blushed. He did not know how to treat her. Yesterday they had kissed each other in the first moment of the joy of meeting, but today he felt he could not do so; he felt that all of them, his mother and sisters, were looking at him questioningly, waiting to see how he behaved with her. He kissed her hand and addressed her as Miss Sonya. But their eyes met without any formality and gave each other a tender kiss. Her look asked forgiveness for daring, through Natasha�s embassy, to remind him of his promise, and thanked him for his love. His look thanked her for the offer of freedom, and said that, one way or another, he would never stop loving her, because it was impossible not to love her.

�How strange it is, though,� said Vera, finding a moment of general silence, �that Sonya and Nikolenka now treat each other like strangers, on formal terms.� Vera�s observation was correct, as were all her observations; but, like most of her observations, this one made everyone feel awkward, and not only Sonya, Nikolai, and Natasha, but even the old countess, who feared that her son�s love for Sonya might deprive him of a brilliant match, blushed like a girl. To Rostov�s surprise, Denisov, in a new uniform, pomaded and perfumed, appeared in the drawing room looking as dashing as he did in battle, and more of an amiable ladies� man than Rostov had ever expected to see him.

Having returned to Moscow from the army, Nikolai Rostov was received by all the family as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling Nikolushka; by relations as a nice, agreeable, and courteous young man; by acquaintances as a handsome hussar lieutenant, an adroit dancer, and one of the best suitors in Moscow.

All Moscow was acquainted with the Rostovs. The old count had enough money that year, because all the estates had been remortgaged, and therefore Nikolushka, having acquired his own trotter and the most fashionable riding breeches, special ones such as no one in Moscow yet had, and the most fashionable boots, with the most pointed toes and small silver spurs, spent his time very gaily. Rostov, on returning home, experienced a pleasant feeling, after measuring himself for a certain time against the old conditions of life. It seemed to him that he had grown and matured greatly. Despair over a failed examination in catechism, borrowing money from Gavrilo for a cab, secret kisses with Sonya�he remembered it all as childishness, from which he was immeasurably far removed now. Now he was a lieutenant of the hussars, in a silver-trimmed dolman, with his soldier�s St. George, preparing his trotter for a race together with well-known, older, respectable fanciers. He had a lady acquaintance on the boulevard, whom he visited in the evenings. He led the mazurka at the Arkharovs� ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal Kamensky, visited the English Club, and was on familiar terms with a forty-year-old colonel whose acquaintance he had made through Denisov.

His passion for the sovereign weakened somewhat in Moscow, since he did not see him during that time. But all the same he often told about the sovereign, about his love for him, letting it be felt that he was not telling all, that there was something else in his feeling for the sovereign that not everyone could understand; and he shared with all his soul the general feeling at that time in Moscow of adoration for the emperor Alexander Pavlovich, who in Moscow at that time was given the nickname of �Angel in the Flesh.�

During Rostov�s short stay in Moscow before leaving for the army, he did not become closer but, on the contrary, drew away from Sonya. She was very pretty, sweet, and obviously passionately in love with him; but he was in that season of youth when one seems to have so much to do that there is no time for that, and a young man is afraid of being tied down�he cherishes his freedom, which he needs for many other things. When he thought about Sonya during his stay in Moscow, he said to himself: �Ah, there will be and there are many, many like her, somewhere, whom I don�t know yet. I�ll still have time, when I want, to occupy myself with love, but right now I�m busy.� Besides, it seemed to him that there was something humiliating to his manliness in women�s society. He went to balls and into women�s society pretending that he was doing so against his will. The races, the English Club, carousing with Denisov, going there�that was another matter: it was suitable to a dashing hussar.

At the beginning of March, the old count Ilya Andreevich Rostov was taken up with arranging a dinner at the English Club in honor of Prince Bagration.

The count walked about the reception hall in his dressing gown, giving orders to the club manager and to the famous Feoktist, the head chef of the English Club, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and fish for Prince Bagration�s dinner. The count had been a member and trustee of the club since the day it was founded. He had been charged by the club with arranging the celebration for Bagration, because few men could arrange a feast with such largesse and hospitality, and especially because few men could and would supply their own money, if it was needed to arrange the feast. The chef and the club manager listened to the count�s orders with cheerful faces, because they knew that with him as with no one else could they profit so well from a dinner costing several thousand.

�So, mind you, cock�s-combs, put cock�s-combs in the tortue, you know!�

�Three cold sauces, then?�� the chef asked.

The count pondered.

�Not less than three�mayonnaise, for one,� he said, counting off on his fingers�

�So your orders are to take the big sterlet?� asked the manager.

�No help for it, take the big ones, since that�s what they�ve got. Ah, dear me, I almost forgot! We must have one more entr&#233;e on the table. Oh, mercy!� He clutched his head. �Who�s going to bring flowers? Mitenka! Hey, Mitenka! Gallop to the Moscow estate, Mitenka,� he said to the steward, who came in on hearing his call, �gallop to the Moscow estate and tell Maximka the gardener to prepare the corv&#233;e now. Tell him to bring the whole conservatory here, wrapped in felt. Two hundred pots must be here by Friday.�

Having given more and more orders of various kinds, he was on his way to rest with his little countess, but remembered another necessary thing, came back himself, brought the chef and the manager back, and again began giving orders. A light male footstep was heard at the door, a jingle of spurs, and the young count came in, handsome, ruddy, with a black little mustache, obviously rested and pampered by his peaceful life in Moscow.

�Ah, my dear fellow! My head is spinning,� said the old man, smiling to his son, as if embarrassed. �You might at least help me! We need singers. I have musicians, but shall we invite some Gypsies? You military folk like that.�

�Really, papa, I think Prince Bagration made less fuss preparing for the battle of Sch&#246;ngraben than you�re doing now,� the son said, smiling.

The old count pretended to be angry.

�Yes, talk, go ahead!�

And the count turned to the chef, who, with an intelligent and respectful face, glanced at the father and son observantly and affectionately.

�How about these young ones, eh, Feoktist?� he said, �laughing at us old folk.�

�Why, Your Excellency, all they want is to eat well, but putting it all together and serving it is none of their business.�

�Right, right!� cried the count, and, merrily seizing his son by both hands, he cried: �I�ve caught you now! Here�s what to do, take the sleigh and pair and go to Bezukhov, and tell him that the count, Ilya Andreich, sends to ask you for some strawberries and fresh pineapples. One can�t get them from anybody else. If he�s not there himself, go and tell the princesses, and from there go to Razgulyai�Ipatka, the coachman, knows where it is�find Ilyushka the Gypsy there, the one who used to dance at Prince Orlov�s, remember, in a white little kaftan, and drag him here to me.�

�Shall I have him bring Gypsy girls?� Nikolai asked, laughing.

�Well, well!��

Just then Anna Mikhailovna stepped inaudibly into the room, with the business-like, preoccupied, and at the same time meek Christian look that never left her. Though Anna Mikhailovna found the count in his dressing gown every day, he became embarrassed each time and apologized for his costume. He did so now as well.

�Never mind, my dear count,� she said, closing her eyes meekly. �And I�ll go to Bezukhov�s myself,� she said. �Young Bezukhov has arrived, and we�ll now get everything from his conservatory. I have to see him anyway. He has sent me a letter from Boris. Thank God, Boris is with the staff now.�

The count was delighted that Anna Mikhailovna was taking on part of his errands, and he ordered the smaller carriage readied for her.

�Tell Bezukhov to come. I�ll put his name down. Is he with his wife?� he asked.

Anna Mikhailovna raised her eyes, and her face expressed deep sorrow�

�Ah, my friend, he�s very unfortunate,� she said. �If what we�ve heard is true, it�s terrible. And could we have thought of it when we rejoiced over his happiness? And such a lofty, heavenly soul, this young Bezukhov! Yes, I pity him with all my soul, and I�ll try to give him comfort, as far as it depends on me.�

�But what is it?� asked both Rostovs, old and young.

Anna Mikhailovna sighed deeply.

�Dolokhov, Marya Ivanovna�s son,� she said in a mysterious whisper, �they say he has totally compromised her. He introduced him, invited him to his house in Petersburg, and now�She has come here, and that daredevil after her,� said Anna Mikhailovna, wishing to express her sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile expressing her sympathy for the daredevil, as she called Dolokhov. �They say Pierre is totally crushed by his grief.�

�Well, all the same, tell him to come to the club�it will distract him. There�ll be a sumptuous feast.�

The next day, the third of March, between one and two in the afternoon, the two hundred and fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting at dinner the dear guest and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince Bagration. At first, when news of the battle of Austerlitz was received, Moscow was thrown into perplexity. At that time the Russians were so used to victories that, on receiving news of the defeat, some simply did not believe it, others sought to explain such a strange occurrence by some extraordinary causes. In the English Club, where all that was elite, had accurate information, and carried weight used to gather, nothing was said in December, when news began to come in about the war and the last battle, as if there was a general agreement to keep silent about it. People who guided conversation, such as Count Rastopchin, Prince Yuri Vladimirovich Dolgoruky, Valuev, Count Markov, and Prince Vyazemsky did not appear at the club, but gathered in people�s houses, in their intimate circles, and those Muscovites who spoke with the voices of others (to whom Count Ilya Andreevich Rostov also belonged), were left for a short time without any definite opinion on the matter of the war and without guidance. The Muscovites felt that something was wrong, and that to discuss this bad news was difficult, and therefore it was better to be silent. But after a while, just as the jurors emerge from the conference room, so the aces appeared again, creating opinion in the club, and all began speaking clearly and definitely. The causes had been found for that unbelievable, unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat, and everything became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things were said. These causes were: the treachery of the Austrians, the bad provisioning of the troops, the treachery of the Pole Przebyszewski and the Frenchman Langeron, the inability of Kutuzov, and (in a low voice) the youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had trusted bad and worthless people. But the troops, the Russian troops, everyone said, were extraordinary and had performed miracles of courage. The soldiers, the officers, and the generals were heroes. But the hero of heroes was Prince Bagration, who won fame for his action at Sch&#246;ngraben and for the retreat from Austerlitz, in which he alone had led his column in order and for a whole day had beaten back a twice-stronger enemy. What contributed to the choice of Bagration as hero in Moscow was that he had no Moscow connections and was an outsider. In his person, honor was paid to the simple Russian fighting soldier, without connections or intrigues, and still associated through memories of the Italian campaign with the name of Suvorov. Besides, rendering him such honors was the best way of showing dislike and disapproval of Kutuzov.

�If there were no Bagration, il faudrait l�inventer,� said the joker Shinshin, parodying the words of Voltaire. No one spoke of Kutuzov, and some denounced him in whispers, calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr.

All over Moscow they repeated the words of Prince Dolgorukov: �Paste, paste, and you get pasted��comforting himself for our defeat with the memory of previous victories, and repeated the words of Rastopchin, that French soldiers had to be urged into battle by high-flown phrases, that with Germans you had to reason logically, persuading them that it was more dangerous to run away than to go forward, but that Russian soldiers only had to be held back and begged to slow down. On all sides more and more new stories were heard about particular examples of courage shown by soldiers and officers at Austerlitz. This one had saved a standard, that one had killed five Frenchmen, that one had loaded five cannons single-handed. It was even said of Berg, by those who did not know him, that, wounded in the right hand, he had taken his sword in his left and forged ahead. Of Bolkonsky nothing was said, and only those who knew him closely regretted that he had died early, leaving his pregnant wife with his eccentric father.


III

On the third of March, the drone of talking voices hung in all the rooms of the English Club and, like bees in spring, the members and guests of the club shuttled back and forth, sat, stood, came together and dispersed again, in uniforms, tailcoats, and some even in powdered wigs and kaftans. Powdered, liveried servants in stockings and buckled shoes stood by every door and strained to catch every movement of the guests and members of the club, in order to offer their services. The majority of those present were venerable old people with broad, self-confident faces, fat fingers, firm movements and voices. This sort of guests and members sat in their known, habitual places, and met together in known, habitual circles. A small part of those present consisted of chance guests�mostly young men, among whom were Denisov, Rostov, and Dolokhov, who had again become an officer of the Semyonovsky regiment. On the faces of the young men, especially the military, there was an expression of that feeling of disdainful deference towards the old men which seemed to say to the older generation: �We�re prepared to respect and honor you, but remember all the same that the future is ours.�

Nesvitsky was there as an old member of the club. Pierre, who, on his wife�s orders, had let his hair grow long and removed his spectacles, was fashionably dressed, but walked about the rooms with a sad and dejected air. As everywhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of people who bowed before his wealth, and he treated them with a habitual lordliness and absentminded disdain.

By his age he should have been with the young people, but by his wealth and connections he was a member of the circle of old, venerable guests, and therefore he kept going from one circle to another. The most distinguished old men were at the centers of the circles, deferentially surrounded even by strangers, who came to listen to the well-known people. Big circles formed around Count Rastopchin, Valuev, and Naryshkin. Rastopchin was telling about how the Russians had been overrun by the fleeing Austrians and had had to use bayonets to make their way through the fugitives.

Valuev told confidentially that Uvarov had been sent from Petersburg to find out the opinion of the Muscovites about Austerlitz.

In the third circle, Naryshkin was talking about the meeting of the Austrian council of war in which Suvorov had crowed like a cock in response to some Austrian general�s stupidity. Shinshin, who was standing there, was about to make a joke, saying that Kutuzov had been unable to learn even that simple skill�of crowing like a cock�from Suvorov; but the old men gave the joker a stern look, letting him feel that there and on that day it was improper to speak like that about Kutuzov.

Count Ilya Andreich Rostov, hurried, preoccupied, paced in his soft boots from dining room to drawing room, greeting in a hasty and perfectly identical manner both important and unimportant persons, all of whom he knew, and, occasionally seeking out his trim, dashing son with his eyes, joyfully rested his gaze on him and winked to him. Young Rostov was standing by the window with Dolokhov, with whom he had recently become acquainted, and whose acquaintance he valued. The old count came up to him and shook Dolokhov�s hand.

�Be so good as to call on us, since you know my fine lad�you�re together there�two heroes�Ah, Vassily Ignatyich�greetings, old boy,� he addressed a little old man who was passing by, but before he finished the greeting everything stirred, and a servant came running with a frightened face and announced: �He�s here!�

There was a ringing of bells; the club stewards rushed forward; scattered through different rooms, the guests, like rye shaken in a shovel, came together in one heap and stopped in the big drawing room by the door to the reception hall.

In the doorway of the anteroom Bagration appeared, without his hat and sword, which, as was customary at the club, he had left with the doorman. He was not in an Astrakhan peaked cap, with a whip over his shoulder, as Rostov had seen him on the eve of the battle of Austerlitz, but in a trim new uniform with Russian and foreign decorations and the star of St. George on his left breast. He had evidently had his hair and side-whiskers trimmed just before the dinner, which changed his physiognomy to its disadvantage. On his face there was something na&#239;vely festive, which, in combination with his firm, manly features, even gave his face a somewhat comical expression. Bekleshov and Fyodor Petrovich Uvarov, who came with him, stopped in the doorway, wishing him, as the main guest, to go ahead of them. Bagration was embarrassed, not wishing to take advantage of their courtesy; a pause in the doorway ensued, and Bagration finally did go ahead of them. He walked over the parquet of the reception hall bashfully and awkwardly, not knowing what to do with his hands; it was easier and more usual for him to walk under bullets over a plowed field, as he had walked ahead of the Kursky regiment at Sch&#246;ngraben. The stewards met him at the first door, spoke a few words to him about the joy of seeing such a dear guest, and, not waiting for him to reply, and as if taking possession of him, surrounded him and led him to the drawing room. It was impossible to go through the door of the drawing room because of the thronging members and guests, who pressed against each other, trying to get a glimpse of Bagration, as of a rare animal, over each other�s shoulders. Count Ilya Andreich�more energetically than anyone, laughing and repeating, �Allow me, mon cher, allow me, allow me!��pushed through the crowd, led the guests to the drawing room, and seated them on the middle sofa. The aces, the club�s most respected members, stood around the new arrivals. Count Ilya Andreich, again pushing through the crowd, left the drawing room and came back a moment later with another steward, carrying a large silver platter, which he offered to Prince Bagration. On the platter lay verses composed and printed in honor of the hero. Seeing the platter, Bagration glanced fearfully around, as if looking for help. But all eyes were demanding that he submit. Feeling himself in their power, Bagration resolutely took the platter in both hands and looked angrily and reproachfully at the count who had offered it to him. Someone obligingly took the platter from Bagration�s hands (otherwise he seemed prepared to hold it that way till evening and go to the table with it), and drew his attention to the verses. �Well, so I�ll read them,� Bagration seemed to say, and, fixing his weary eyes on the paper, he began to read with a concentrated and serious look. The author himself took the verses from him and began to read. Prince Bagration inclined his head and listened.


Glorify, then, the age of Alexander

And keep our noble Titus on the throne,

Be both a good man and a fierce commander,

Caesar in battle, Ripheus at home.

And fortunate Napoleon,

Taught by experience of Bagration,

The Russian Alcides dares no more to scorn�


But before he finished the verses, the loud-voiced butler announced: �Dinner is served!� The door opened, from the dining room thundered the polonaise: �Thunder of victory resound, be of good cheer, O valiant Russ���and Count Ilya Andreich, glancing angrily at the author, who went on reading his verses, bowed before Bagration. They all stood up, feeling that dinner was more important than verses, and again Bagration went ahead of everyone to the table. He was seated in the first place, between two Alexanders�Bekleshov and Naryshkin�which also made reference to the sovereign�s name. Three hundred people were then seated in the dining room by rank and importance, the more important closer to the guest of honor, as naturally as water flows deeper where the terrain is lower.

Just before dinner, Count Ilya Andreich introduced his son to the prince. Bagration, recognizing him, spoke a few incoherent, awkward words, like all the words he spoke that day. While Bagration was talking with his son, Count Ilya Andreich looked everyone over joyfully and proudly.

Nikolai Rostov, with Denisov and his new acquaintance, Dolokhov, sat together almost at the middle of the table. Opposite them sat Pierre, beside Prince Nesvitsky. Count Ilya Andreich sat opposite Bagration, together with the other stewards, and did the honors for Prince Bagration, personifying Moscow hospitality in himself.

His labors had not gone in vain. The dinners�both lenten and non-lenten�were splendid, but even so he could not be perfectly at ease until dinner was over. He winked to the barman, whispered orders to the servants, and waited not without anxiety for each familiar dish. Everything was excellent. With the second course, along with a giant sterlet (seeing which Ilya Andreich blushed from joy and bashfulness), the servants began to pop corks and pour champagne. After the fish, which produced a certain impression, Count Ilya Andreich exchanged glances with the other stewards. �There�ll be many toasts, it�s time to begin!� he whispered, and, taking a glass in his hand, he arose. Everyone fell silent and waited for what he would say.

�To the health of our sovereign emperor!� he cried, and at the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and rapture. At that same moment, the �Thunder of victory resound� was played. They all rose from their seats and shouted �Hurrah!� Bagration, too, shouted �Hurrah!� in the same voice in which he had shouted on the field of Sch&#246;ngraben. Young Rostov�s rapturous voice could be heard above the other three hundred voices. He was almost weeping.

�To the health of the sovereign emperor!� he cried. �Hurrah!� Emptying his glass at one gulp, he flung it on the floor. Many followed his example. And the loud shouts continued for a long time. When the voices died down, the servants cleared away the broken glass, and everybody began to take their seats, smiling at their own shouts and talking among themselves. Count Ilya Andreevich rose again, glanced at the little note that lay next to his plate, and pronounced a toast to the health of the hero of our latest campaign, Prince Pyotr Ivanovich Bagration, and again the count�s blue eyes grew moist with tears. �Hurrah!� the voices of the three hundred guests shouted again, and, instead of music, a choir was heard, singing a cantata composed by Pavel Ivanovich Kutuzov:


Vain are all barriers to Russians,

In us victory and valor meet,

We have our Bagrations,

All enemies will be at our feet�etc.


As soon as the choir finished, more and more new toasts followed, at which Count Ilya Andreevich grew more and more sentimental, and more glasses were smashed, and more shouts were heard. They drank to the health of Bekleshov, Naryshkin, Uvarov, Dolgorukov, Apraksin, Valuev, to the health of the stewards, to the health of the manager, to the health of all the members of the club, to the health of all the guests of the club, and finally, separately, to the health of the dinner�s host, Count Ilya Andreevich. At this toast, the count took out his handkerchief, covered his face, and burst completely into tears.


IV

Pierre was sitting across from Dolokhov and Nikolai Rostov. He ate a lot and greedily, and drank a lot, as usual. But those who knew him intimately could see that some great change had taken place in him that day. He was silent all through dinner and, squinting and wincing, looked around him or, fixing his eyes with a completely absentminded air, rubbed the bridge of his nose with his finger. His face was dejected and gloomy. He seemed to see and hear nothing of what was going on around him and to be thinking of some one painful and unresolved thing.

This unresolved question that tormented him came from the hints of the young princess in Moscow at Dolokhov�s intimacy with his wife, and from an anonymous letter he had received that morning, which said, with the mean jocularity of all anonymous letters, that he saw poorly through his spectacles and that his wife�s liaison with Dolokhov was a secret to no one but him. Pierre decidedly did not believe either the princess�s hints or the letter, but it was scary for him now to look at Dolokhov, who was sitting in front of him. Each time his gaze chanced to meet Dolokhov�s handsome, insolent eyes, Pierre felt something terrible and ugly rise up in his soul, and he quickly turned away. Involuntarily recalling all his wife�s past and her relations with Dolokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be true, might at least seem true, if it had not concerned his wife. Pierre involuntarily recalled how Dolokhov, to whom everything had been restored after the campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come to see him. Using his relations of carousing friendship with Pierre, Dolokhov had come straight to his house, and Pierre had put him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled how H&#233;l&#232;ne, smiling, had expressed her displeasure at Dolokhov�s living in their house, and how Dolokhov had cynically praised his wife�s beauty to him, and how from then until they came to Moscow, he had not parted from them for a minute.

�Yes, he�s very handsome,� thought Pierre, �I know him. For him there would be a special charm in disgracing my name and laughing at me, precisely because I solicited for him, took him in, and helped him. I know, I understand what salt it would give his deceit in his own eyes, if it were true. Yes, if it were true; but I don�t believe it, I have no right to and cannot believe it.� He recalled the expression Dolokhov�s face assumed in moments when cruelty came over him, as when he tied the policeman to the bear and threw him into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel for no reason, or killed a cabby�s horse with a pistol. That expression was often on Dolokhov�s face when he looked at him. �Yes, he�s a duellist,� thought Pierre, �to kill a man is nothing to him, he must think everybody�s afraid of him, it must make him feel good. He must think I�m also afraid of him. And, in fact, I am afraid of him,� thought Pierre, and again, at these thoughts, he felt something frightful and ugly rise up in his soul. Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov now sat facing Pierre and seemed very merry. Rostov talked merrily with his two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar, the other a notorious duellist and scapegrace, and from time to time glanced mockingly at Pierre, who stood out at this dinner because of his concentrated, absentminded, massive figure. Rostov looked at Pierre unkindly, first, because in his hussar�s eyes Pierre was a rich civilian, the husband of a beauty, and generally an old woman; second, because Pierre, in his concentrated and absentminded mood, had not recognized Rostov and had not responded to his bow. When they drank to the sovereign�s health, Pierre, being deep in thought, did not rise or take his glass.

�What�s with you?� Rostov shouted, looking at him with rapturously spiteful eyes. �Don�t you hear: to the health of the sovereign emperor!� Pierre sighed, rose obediently, drank his glass, and, waiting for everyone to sit down, turned to Rostov with his kindly smile.

�And I just didn�t recognize you,� he said. But Rostov could not be bothered, he was shouting �Hurrah!�

�Why don�t you renew your acquaintance?� Dolokhov said to Rostov.

�He�s a fool, God help him,� said Rostov.

�We must cherish the husbands of pretty women,� said Denisov.

Pierre did not hear what they were saying, but he knew it was about him. He blushed and turned away.

�Well, now to the health of beautiful women,� said Dolokhov, and with a serious expression, but with a smile at the corners of his mouth, he turned to Pierre, glass in hand. �To the health of beautiful women, Petrusha, and of their lovers,� he said.

Pierre, his eyes lowered, drank from his glass without looking at Dolokhov or answering him. The servant who was handing out Kutuzov�s cantata laid a sheet before Pierre, as one of the more honored guests. Pierre was about to pick it up, but Dolokhov leaned across, snatched it from his hand, and began to read it. Pierre looked at Dolokhov, the pupils of his eyes sank: the something terrible and ugly that had sickened him during dinner rose up and took possession of him. He leaned his entire corpulent body across the table.

�Don�t you dare take it!� he cried.

Hearing this cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesvitsky and Pierre�s neighbor on the right turned fearfully and hastily to Bezukhov.

�Enough, enough, what�s wrong?� frightened voices whispered. Dolokhov looked at Pierre with his light, merry, cruel eyes, and with the same smile, as if saying: �Ah, this is what I like.�

�I won�t give it to you,� he said distinctly.

Pale, his lip trembling, Pierre tore at the page.

�You�you�are a scoundrel!�I challenge you!� he said and, having moved his chair back, he got up from the table. The very second he did so and uttered those words, he felt that the question of his wife�s guilt, which had tormented him all that past day, was definitively and indubitably resolved in the affirmative. He hated her and was severed from her forever. In spite of Denisov�s pleas that Rostov not get involved in the affair, Rostov agreed to be Dolokhov�s second, and after dinner talked over the conditions of the duel with Nesvitsky, Bezukhov�s second. Pierre went home, and Rostov sat in the club with Dolokhov and Denisov till late in the evening, listening to the Gypsies and the singers.

�So, till tomorrow in Sokolniki,� said Dolokhov, taking leave of Rostov on the porch of the club.

�And you�re calm?� asked Rostov.

Dolokhov stopped.

�Look, I�ll reveal to you in two words the whole secret of a duel. If you�re going to a duel, and you write your will and tender letters to your parents, if you think you may be killed, you�re a fool and are certainly lost; you should go with the firm intention of killing him as quickly and certainly as possible; then everything�s in good order, as our bear hunter in Kostroma used to say. �How can you not be afraid of a bear?� he�d say. �But once you see him, your fear goes away, except of letting him escape!� Well, that�s how I am. &#192; demain, mon cher.�

The next day, at eight o�clock in the morning, Pierre and Nesvitsky arrived at the Sokolniki woods and found Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov already there. Pierre had the look of a man occupied with some considerations of no concern to the present affair. His pinched face was yellow. He obviously had not slept that night. He looked around absentmindedly and winced as if from the bright sun. Two considerations occupied him exclusively: the guilt of his wife, of which, after the sleepless night, not the least doubt remained; and the innocence of Dolokhov, who had no reason whatever to preserve the honor of a man who was a stranger to him. �Maybe I would have done the same thing in his place,� thought Pierre. �I even certainly would have done the same thing. Why this duel, this murder? Either I�ll kill him, or he�ll hit me in the head, in the elbow, in the knee. Leave here, run away, bury myself somewhere,� came to his head. But precisely in the moments when such thoughts came to him, he, with that especially calm and absentminded air, which inspired respect in those who looked at him, would ask: �Will it be soon, are we ready?�

When everything was ready, the swords stuck in the snow to mark the barrier to which they had to walk, and the pistols loaded, Nesvitsky came over to Pierre.

�I would not be fulfilling my duty, Count,� he said in a timid voice, �and would not justify the trust and honor you have shown me by choosing me as your second, if I did not tell you the whole truth at this important, this very important, moment. I think this affair has no sufficient grounds and is not worth shedding blood over�You were wrong, you lost your temper��

�Ah, yes, terribly stupid�� said Pierre.

�Then allow me to convey your regrets, and I�m certain that our adversaries will agree to accept your apology,� said Nesvitsky (like the other participants in the affair, and like everyone in similar affairs, not believing that things would go so far as an actual duel). �You know, Count, it�s much more noble to acknowledge your mistake than to bring the matter to a point beyond repair�There was no offense on either side. Allow me to talk it over��

�No, what is there to talk about!� said Pierre. �It makes no difference�So, are we ready?� he added. �Only tell me, where am I to go and where am I to shoot?� he said with an unnaturally meek smile. He took the pistol in his hands and began asking how to pull the trigger, because until then he had never handled a pistol, something he did not want to admit. �Ah, yes, like that, I know, I just forgot,� he said.

�No apologies, decidedly nothing,� Dolokhov replied to Denisov, who for his part also made an attempt at reconciliation, and he also walked to the designated place.

The place chosen for the duel was some eighty paces off the road, where the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine woods, covered with snow wet from the thaw that had set in over the last few days. The adversaries stood some forty paces from each other, at the edges of the clearing. Nesvitsky and Denisov, measuring out the paces, left tracks imprinted in the deep, wet snow from the places where they were standing to their swords, marking the barrier and stuck into the ground ten paces apart. The thaw and the fog persisted; at a distance of forty paces they could not see each other clearly. In three minutes all was ready, and still they were slow to begin. Everyone was silent.

�Well, begin!� said Dolokhov.

�Let�s,� said Pierre, with the same smile.

It was becoming frightening. It was obvious that the affair, having begun so lightly, could no longer be prevented by anything, that it was going on by itself, independently of men�s will, and would be accomplished. Denisov first went to the barrier and announced:

�Since the adversaries have refused a reconciliation, kindly begin: take your pistols and at the word three start walking towards each other.�

�O-one! Two! Three!�� Denisov cried out angrily and stepped aside. The two men began walking over the imprinted tracks, getting closer and closer, and recognizing each other in the fog. The adversaries had the right to fire at any time while coming to the barrier. Dolokhov walked slowly, without raising his pistol, his light, shining blue eyes peering into his adversary�s face. On his mouth there was, as usual, the semblance of a smile.

At the word three, Pierre walked forward with quick steps, getting off the beaten track and stepping into the untouched snow. Pierre stretched his arm out and held the pistol as if he was afraid of killing himself with it. He carefully put his left hand behind him, because he would have liked to support his right hand with it, and he knew that was not allowed. Having gone some six paces and veered off the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet, again gave a quick glance at Dolokhov, and, pulling his finger as he had been taught, fired. Never expecting such a loud noise, Pierre gave a start, then smiled at his own impression and stood still. The smoke, especially thick because of the fog, at first prevented him from seeing anything; but the other shot he was expecting did not follow. All he could hear were Dolokhov�s hurrying steps; then his figure appeared through the smoke. He was holding one hand to his left side, the other clutched his lowered pistol. His face was pale. Rostov ran over and said something to him.

�N-no,� Dolokhov said through his teeth, �no, it�s not over,� and, taking several more dipping, hobbling steps to the sword, he fell on the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he wiped it on his coat and propped himself up with it. His face was pale, frowning, and trembled.

�Kind�� Dolokhov began but could not get the word out, �kindly,� he finished with effort. Pierre, barely holding back his sobs, ran towards Dolokhov and was about to cross the space separating the barriers when Dolokhov cried: �To the barrier!� And Pierre, realizing what it was about, stopped at his sword. Only ten paces separated them. Dolokhov lowered his head to the snow, bit at it greedily, raised his head again, pulled himself together, tucked his legs under, and sat up, trying to find a steady point of balance. He filled his mouth with cold snow and sucked on it; his lips trembled, but went on smiling; his eyes glittered with the effort and the anger of a last summoning of strength. He raised his pistol and began to take aim.

�Turn, cover yourself with the pistol,� said Nesvitsky.

�Cover yourself!� even Denisov could not help crying to his adversary.

Pierre, with a meek smile of pity and regret, his legs and arms spread helplessly, his broad chest exposed, stood before Dolokhov and looked at him sorrowfully. Denisov, Rostov, and Nesvitsky closed their eyes. The shot and Dolokhov�s angry cry came simultaneously.

�Missed!� cried Dolokhov, and, strengthless, he sprawled face down on the snow. Pierre clutched his head and, turning around, walked off towards the woods, treading on the untouched snow and mouthing incoherent words aloud.

�Stupid�stupid! Death�lies�,� he repeated, wincing. Nesvitsky stopped him and took him home.

Rostov and Denisov drove off with the wounded Dolokhov.

Dolokhov, silent, his eyes closed, lay in the sleigh and did not answer a word to the questions they put to him; but as they entered Moscow, he suddenly came to and, raising his head with difficulty, took the hand of Rostov, who was sitting next to him. Rostov was struck by the totally altered, unexpectedly and rapturously tender expression on Dolokhov�s face.

�Well, so? how do you feel?� asked Rostov.

�Rotten! but that�s not the point. My friend,� said Dolokhov in a halting voice, �where are we? We�re in Moscow, I know. Never mind me, but I�ve killed her, killed�She won�t survive it. She won�t survive��

�Who?� asked Rostov.

�My mother. My mother, my angel, my adored angel, my mother.� And Dolokhov wept, pressing Rostov�s hand. When he had calmed down a little, he explained to Rostov that he lived with his mother, that if his mother saw him dying, she wouldn�t survive it. He begged Rostov to go and prepare her.

Rostov went on ahead to carry out his errand, and, to his great surprise, discovered that Dolokhov, this rowdy duellist, lived in Moscow with his old mother and hunchbacked sister, and was a most affectionate son and brother.


VI

Of late Pierre had rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg and in Moscow, their house was constantly full of guests. The night after the duel, he did not go to his bedroom, but remained, as he often did, in his father�s enormous study, the same in which old Count Bezukhov had died. Tormenting as the inner work of the previous sleepless night had been, still more tormenting work was beginning now.

He lay down on the sofa and wanted to fall asleep in order to forget all that had happened to him, but he could not do it. Such a storm of feelings, thoughts, and memories suddenly arose in his soul that he not only could not sleep, but could not stay in place and had to jump up from the sofa and pace the room with quick steps. Now he pictured her in the initial time of their marriage, with bared shoulders and weary, passionate eyes, and at once beside her he pictured Dolokhov�s handsome, insolent, and firmly mocking face, as it had been at the dinner, and the same face of Dolokhov, pale, trembling, and suffering, as it had been when he turned and fell on the snow.

�What has happened?� he asked himself. �I killed a lover, yes, I killed my wife�s lover. Yes, it happened. Why? How did I come to that?� �Because you married her,� an inner voice answered.

�But what am I to blame for?� he asked. �For having married her without loving her, for deceiving both myself and her,� and he vividly pictured that moment after supper at Prince Vassily�s, when he had spoken those words: �Je vous aime,� which had refused to come out of him. �It�s all because of that! I felt then, too,� he thought, �I felt then that it was wrong, that I had no right to it. And so it turned out.� He recalled their honeymoon and blushed at the recollection. Especially vivid, insulting, and shameful for him was the recollection of how once, soon after his marriage, he had come from his bedroom to his study, before noon, wearing a silk dressing gown, and in his study had found his head steward, who bowed respectfully, looked at Pierre�s face, at his dressing gown, and smiled slightly, as if expressing with this smile a respectful sympathy for his employer�s happiness.

�And how many times I felt proud of her,� he thought, �proud of her majestic beauty, her worldly tact; proud of my house, in which she received all Petersburg, proud of her inaccessibility and beauty. So this is what I was proud of?! I thought then that I didn�t understand her. How often, pondering her character, I said to myself that I was to blame, that I didn�t understand her, didn�t understand that eternal calm, contentment, and lack of any predilections and desires, and the whole answer was in this terrible word, that she is a depraved woman: I said this terrible word to myself, and everything became clear!

�Anatole would come to borrow money from her and would kiss her bare shoulders. She didn�t give him the money, but allowed him to kiss her. Her father, joking, tried to arouse her jealousy; she said with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: he can do as he likes, she said of me. I asked her once whether she felt any signs of pregnancy. She laughed scornfully and said she was not such a fool as to want to have children, and that she would not have children from me.�

Then he recalled the clarity and coarseness of thought and the vulgarity of expression typical of her, despite her upbringing in high aristocratic circles. �I�m not such a fool�go and give it a try�allez vous promener� she used to say. Often, looking at her success in the eyes of old and young men and women, Pierre could not understand why he did not love her. �And I never loved her,� Pierre said to himself. �I knew she was a depraved woman,� he repeated, �but I didn�t dare admit it to myself.�

�And now Dolokhov�sitting on the snow, with a forced smile, maybe dying, and responding to my regret with some sort of swagger!�

Pierre was one of those people who, despite their ostensible weakness of character, as it is called, do not seek to confide their grief. He worked over his grief alone with himself.

�She, she alone is to blame for everything, everything,� he said to himself. �But what of it? Why did I bind myself to her, why did I say that �Je vous aime� to her, which was a lie, and still worse than a lie,� he said to himself. �I�m to blame and I must bear�But what? The disgrace to my name, the unhappiness of my life? Eh, it�s all nonsense,� he thought, �the disgrace to my name and honor�it�s all a convention, it�s all independent of me.�

�Louis XVI was executed for being, as they said, dishonest and criminal,� came into Pierre�s head, �and they were right from their point of view, and equally right were those who died a martyr�s death for him and counted him among the saints. Then Robespierre was executed because he was a despot. Who�s right, and who�s wrong? No one. You�re alive�so live: tomorrow you�ll die, just as I could have died an hour ago. And is it worth suffering, when there�s only a second left to live compared with eternity?� But the moment he considered himself comforted by this sort of reasoning, he suddenly pictured her in those moments when he had shown her his insincere love most intensely, and he felt the blood rush to his heart, and he had to get up again and move about, and break and tear things that happened to be within his reach. �Why did I say �Je vous aime� to her?� he kept repeating to himself. And, having repeated this question for the tenth time, Moliere�s mais que diable allait-il faire dans cette gal&#232;re? came to his head, and he laughed at himself.

In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to Petersburg. He could not remain under the same roof with her. He could not imagine how he was going to speak to her now. He decided that he would go the next day and leave her a letter in which he would announce his intention to part with her forever.

In the morning, when the valet came into his study bringing coffee, Pierre was lying asleep on the sofa with an open book in his hand.

He woke up and looked around fearfully for a long time, unable to understand where he was.

�The countess told me to ask whether Your Excellency is at home,� said the valet.

But before Pierre decided on what answer he would give, the countess herself, in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver, and with her hair done up simply (two enormous braids wound twice around her lovely head en diad&#232;me), came into the room calmly and majestically; only there was a wrinkle of wrath on her marble and slightly prominent forehead. With her all-enduring calm, she refrained from speaking in front of the valet. She knew about the duel and had come to talk about it. She waited until the valet set down the coffee and went out. Pierre looked at her timidly through his spectacles and, as a hare surrounded by hounds presses its ears back and goes on sitting in full view of its enemies, so he attempted to go on reading; but he felt that it was senseless and impossible, and again glanced at her timidly. She did not sit down and looked at him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to leave.

�What is this? What have you done, I ask you?� she said sternly.

�I?�what? I�� said Pierre.

�What a brave fellow we�ve got here! Well, answer, what is this duel? What did you want to prove by it? What, I ask you.� Pierre shifted heavily on the sofa, opened his mouth, but could not answer.

�Since you don�t answer, I�ll tell you�� H&#233;l&#232;ne went on. �You believe everything you�re told. You were told�� H&#233;l&#232;ne laughed, �that Dolokhov is my lover,� she said in French, with her coarse precision of speech, pronouncing the word lover like any other word, �and you believed it! But what did you prove by it? What did you prove by this duel? That you�re a fool, que vous &#234;tes un sot; everybody knew that anyway. What will it lead to? That I will become the laughing-stock of all Moscow; that everyone will say that you, in a drunken state, forgetting yourself, challenged to a duel a man of whom you were groundlessly jealous,� H&#233;l&#232;ne raised her voice and became more and more inspired, �and who is better than you in all respects��

�Hm�hm�� Pierre grunted, without looking at her or stirring any limb of his body.

�And why should you believe that he is my lover?�Why? Because I like his company? If you were more intelligent and agreeable, I�d prefer yours.�

�Don�t speak to me�I beg you,� Pierre whispered hoarsely.

�Why shouldn�t I speak! I can speak, and I�ll say boldly that there are few wives who wouldn�t take lovers (des amants) with a husband like you, but I didn�t do that,� she said. Pierre wanted to say something, gave her a strange look, the expression of which she did not understand, and lay back again. He was suffering physically at that moment: there was a tightness in his chest, and he could not breathe. He knew he had to do something to stop this suffering, but what he wanted to do was too terrible.

�It�s better for us to part,� he said haltingly.

�We�ll part, if you please, but only if you give me a fortune,� said H&#233;l&#232;ne��To part�how scary!�

Pierre jumped up from the sofa and, staggering, rushed at her.

�I�ll kill you!� he shouted, and with a strength as yet unknown to him, he seized the marble slab from a table, took a step towards her, and swung.

H&#233;l&#232;ne�s face became frightful; she shrieked and sprang away from him. His father�s blood told in him. Pierre felt the enthusiasm and enchantment of rage. He threw down the slab, broke it, and, approaching H&#233;l&#232;ne with widespread arms, shouted �Out!� in such a frightful voice that everybody in the house was terrified on hearing this shout. God knows what Pierre would have done at that moment if H&#233;l&#232;ne had not run out of the room.

A week later Pierre gave his wife power of attorney for the management of all his estates in Great Russia, which formed the major part of his fortune, and left alone for Petersburg.


VII

Two months had gone by since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and the loss of Prince Andrei was received at Bald Hills. And, despite all the letters sent through the embassy, despite all the searches, his body had not been found, nor was he among the prisoners. Worst of all for his family was that there still remained a hope that he had been picked up by the local populace on the battlefield and might be lying somewhere recovering or dying alone, among strangers, unable to send news of himself. In the newspapers, from which the old prince had first learned of the defeat at Austerlitz, it was written, as usual, quite briefly and indefinitely, that, after brilliant battles, the Russians had been forced to retreat, and that the retreat had been carried out in perfect order. From this official report the old prince understood that the Russians had been defeated. A week after the newspapers brought news of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from Kutuzov, which informed the prince of the fate that had befallen his son.

�Before my eyes,� wrote Kutuzov, �your son, with a standard in his hands, at the head of a regiment, fell as a hero worthy of his father and his fatherland. To the general regret of myself and the entire army, it is still unknown whether he is alive or not. I flatter myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise he would be among the officers found on the battlefield and his name would be on the list given me by the peace envoys.�

Having received this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his study, the old prince did not say anything to anyone. As usual, the next day he went for his morning walk; but he was silent with the steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though he looked angry, he said nothing to anyone.

When Princess Marya came into his study at the usual time, he was standing and working at his lathe, but, as usual, did not turn to her.

�Ah! Princess Marya!� he suddenly said unnaturally and threw down his chisel. (The wheel went on turning by inertia. Princess Marya long remembered the dying creak of the wheel, which merged for her with what followed after.)

Princess Marya moved towards him, saw his face, and something suddenly sank inside her. Her eyes ceased to see clearly. By her father�s face, not sad, not crushed, but angry and working itself unnaturally, she could see that there, there above her, hanging over her and crushing her, was a terrible misfortune, the worst misfortune in life, one she had not yet experienced, an irreparable, inconceivable misfortune�the death of a loved one.

�Mon p&#232;re�Andr&#233;?� said the graceless, awkward princess, with such an inexpressible loveliness of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father could not endure her gaze and, sobbing, turned away.

�I�ve received news. He�s not among the prisoners, and not among the dead. Kutuzov writes,� he cried shrilly, as if wishing to drive the princess away with this cry, �he�s been killed!�

The princess did not fall, did not feel faint. She had been pale to begin with, but when she heard these words, her face changed and something lit up in her luminous, beautiful eyes. It was as if joy, the supreme joy, independent of the sorrows and joys of this world, poured over the deep sorrow that was in her. She forgot all her fear of her father, went up to him, took him by the hand, pulled him to her, and embraced his dry, sinewy neck.

�Mon p&#232;re,� she said. �Don�t turn away from me, let�s weep together.�

�Villains! Scoundrels!� cried the old man, pulling his face away from her. �To destroy an army, to destroy men! Why? Go, go and tell Liza.�

The princess sank strengthlessly into the armchair next to her father and wept. She now saw her brother at the moment when he had taken leave of her and Liza, with his tender and at the same time arrogant air, saw him at the moment when, tenderly and mockingly, he had put on the little icon. �Did he believe? Did he repent of his unbelief? Was he now there? There, in the place of eternal rest and bliss?� she wondered.

�Mon p&#232;re, tell me how it happened?� she asked through her tears.

�Go, go; he was killed in a battle, into which they led the best of Russian men and Russian glory to be killed. Go, Princess Marya. Go and tell Liza. I�ll come.�

When Princess Marya came back from her father, the little princess was sitting over her work, and she looked at Princess Marya with that special expression of an inward and happily serene gaze that only pregnant women have. It was clear that she did not see Princess Marya, but was looking deep inside herself�into something happy and mysterious that was being accomplished in her.

�Marie,� she said, leaving the embroidery frame and throwing herself backwards, �give me your hand.� She took the princess�s hand and placed it on her belly.

Her eyes were smiling in expectation, her little lip with its mustache rose and remained raised in a childishly happy way.

Princess Marya knelt before her and hid her face in the folds of her sister-in-law�s dress.

�There, there�do you feel it? It�s so strange. And you know, Marie, I�ll love him very much,� said Liza, looking at her sister-in-law with shining, happy eyes. Princess Marya could not raise her head: she was weeping.

�What�s the matter, Masha?�

�Never mind�I just feel sad�sad about Andrei,� she said, wiping her tears on her sister-in-law�s knees. Several times in the course of the morning Princess Marya began to prepare her sister-in-law, and each time she began to weep. These tears, the reason for which the little princess did not understand, alarmed her, though she was little attentive. She did not say anything, but glanced around anxiously, as if looking for something. Before dinner the old prince, whom she had always been afraid of, came into her room, now with an especially uneasy, angry face, and left without saying a word. She looked at Princess Marya, then became thoughtful, with that expression of inward attention that pregnant women have, and suddenly began to cry.

�Have you received something from Andrei?� she asked.

�No, you know it�s still too early for any news, but mon p&#232;re worries, and I�m frightened.�

�So there�s nothing?�

�Nothing,� said Princess Marya, looking firmly at her sister-in-law with her luminous eyes. She had decided not to tell her and persuaded her father to conceal the terrible news from her sister-in-law until her delivery, which was expected any day. Princess Marya and the old prince, in their own ways, bore with the grief and concealed it. The old prince did not want to hope: he decided that Prince Andrei had been killed, and though he sent an official to Austria to look for his son�s traces, he ordered a gravestone for him in Moscow, which he intended to put in his garden, and told everyone that his son had been killed. He tried to go on with his old way of life unchanged, but his strength failed him: he walked less, ate less, slept less, and grew weaker every day. Princess Marya went on hoping. She prayed for her brother as for one of the living, and expected news of his return any moment.


VIII

�Ma bonne amie,� the little princess said on the morning of the nineteenth of March, and her mustached little lip rose by old habit; but as, ever since the day the terrible news had been received, there had been sorrow not only in the smiles, but in the sounds of talk, even in the footsteps in that house, so now the smile of the little princess, who had succumbed to the general mood�though she did not know its cause�was such that it was all the more a reminder of the general sorrow.

�Ma bonne amie, je crains que le fruschtique (comme dit Foka, the cook) de ce matin ne m�aie pas fait du mal.�

�What�s the matter, darling? You�re pale. Ah, you�re very pale,� Princess Marya said fearfully, rushing to her sister-in-law with her heavy, soft steps.

�Your Excellency, shouldn�t we send for Marya Bogdanovna?� asked one of the maids. (Marya Bogdanovna was a midwife from the provincial capital, who had already been living at Bald Hills for over a week.)

�Indeed,� Princess Marya picked up, �you may be right. I�ll go. Courage, mon ange!� She kissed Liza and was about to leave the room.

�Ah, no, no!��and besides the paleness, the face of the little princess showed a childish fear of unavoidable physical suffering.

�Non, c�est l�estomac�dites que c�est l�estomac, dites, Marie, dites�� And the princess wept with a capricious child�s suffering, even shamming somewhat, wringing her little hands. The princess ran out of the room to fetch Marya Bogdanovna.

�Oh! Mon dieu! Mon dieu!� she heard behind her.

The midwife was already coming to meet her, with a significantly calm face, rubbing her small, plump, white hands.

�Marya Bogdanovna! It seems it�s begun,� said Princess Marya, looking at the midwife with frightened, wide-open eyes.

�Well, thank God, Princess,� Marya Bogdanovna said, without quickening her pace. �You young girls oughtn�t to know about these things.�

�But the doctor hasn�t come from Moscow yet,� said the princess. (At the wishes of Liza and Prince Andrei, they had sent to Moscow in due time for an accoucheur, and he was expected at any moment.)

�Never mind, Princess, don�t worry,� said Marya Bogdanovna, �everything will be fine without the doctor.�

Five minutes later, in her rooms, the princess heard something heavy being carried. She peeked out�the servants were for some reason carrying a leather sofa that had been in Prince Andrei�s study. There was something solemn and quiet in the carriers� faces.

Princess Marya sat alone in her room, listening to the noises in the house, opening her door from time to time when someone passed by, and watching over what was happening in the corridor. Several women passed back and forth there with soft steps, glanced at the princess, and turned away from her. She did not dare ask anything, closed her door, returned to her room, and now sat in her armchair, now took her prayer book, now knelt before the icons. Unfortunately, and to her astonishment, she felt that prayer did not calm her agitation. Suddenly the door to her room opened quietly, and her old nanny Praskovya Savishna, who hardly ever came to her room, because the old prince forbade it, appeared in the doorway, her head bound with a kerchief.

�I�ve come to sit with you, Mashenka,� said the nanny, �and here I�ve brought the prince�s wedding candles to light before the saint, my angel,� she said, sighing.

�Ah, I�m so glad, nanny.�

�God is merciful, dear heart.� The nanny lit the gold-decorated candles in front of the icon stand and sat down by the door with her knitting. Princess Marya took a book and began to read. Only when steps or voices were heard, they looked at each other, the princess fearfully, questioningly, and the nanny soothingly. The same feeling that Princess Marya was experiencing as she sat in her room came over everyone and spread to all ends of the house. Following the belief that the less people know about the suffering of a woman in labor, the less she suffers, everyone tried to pretend they knew nothing; no one spoke of it, but, apart from the usual staidness and respectfulness of good manners that prevailed in the prince�s house, one could see a sort of general concern, a softness of heart, and the awareness of something great, inconceivable, that was being accomplished at that moment.

No laughter was heard in the big maids� room. In the footmen�s quarters the men all sat silently, ready for something. The caretakers did not sleep and had splinters and candles burning. The old prince paced his study, stepping on his heels, and sent Tikhon to Marya Bogdanovna to ask what news.

�Just say the prince told me to ask what news. And come and tell me what she says.�

�Tell the prince that labor has begun,� said Marya Bogdanovna, glancing significantly at the messenger. Tikhon went and told him.

�Very well,� said the prince, closing the door behind him, and Tikhon did not hear the least sound from the study after that. A little later, Tikhon went into the study as if to tend to the candles. Seeing the prince lying on the sofa, Tikhon looked at him, at his upset face, shook his head, silently went over to him, kissed him on the shoulder, and went out without tending to the candles or saying why he had come. The mystery, the most solemn in the world, continued to be accomplished. Evening passed, night came. And the feeling of expectation and of the heart�s softness before the inconceivable did not diminish, but heightened. No one slept.

It was one of those March nights when it is as if winter wants to claim its own back and with desperate malice pours out its last snows and storms. The German doctor from Moscow was expected any moment, a carriage had been sent for him to the turning from the highway to the country road, and mounted men with lanterns went to lead him along the bumpy and muddy road.

Princess Marya had long ago abandoned her book: she was sitting silently, her luminous eyes fixed on her nanny�s wrinkled face, familiar to her in the smallest detail: on the lock of gray hair that strayed from under her kerchief, at the little pouch of skin that hung under her chin.

The nanny Savishna, holding her knitting, was telling in a low voice, herself not hearing or understanding the words, the story she had told a hundred times, about how the late princess had given birth to Princess Marya in Kishinev, with a Moldavian peasant woman instead of a midwife.

�With God�s mercy, there�s no need for any dokhturs,� she said. Suddenly a gust of wind blew open the poorly latched window (at the prince�s behest, with the coming of the larks, one frame of the double windows was removed in each room), sent the heavy silk curtain fluttering, blew in cold and snow, and put out the candle. Princess Marya shuddered; the nanny set her knitting down, went to the window, leaned out, and began snatching at the open window frame. Cold wind blew about the ends of her kerchief and her stray locks of gray hair.

�Princess, dearest, somebody�s driving down the avenue!� she said, holding the frame and not closing it. �With lanterns. Must be the dokhtur.�

�Ah, my God! Thank God!� said Princess Marya. �I must go and meet him; he doesn�t know Russian.�

Princess Marya threw on her shawl and ran to meet the arrivals. As she went down the hall, she saw through the window a carriage with lanterns standing by the porch. She went out to the stairs. A tallow candle stood on a baluster, melting in the wind. The servant Filipp, with an alarmed face and holding another candle, stood below on the first landing of the stairs. Still lower, around the turning of the stairs, footsteps in warm boots could be heard. And a voice that seemed familiar to Princess Marya was saying something.

�Thank God!� said the voice. �And father?�

�Gone to bed,� replied the voice of the butler Demyan, who was already downstairs.

Then the voice said something else, Demyan made some reply, and the footsteps in warm boots began to approach more quickly the invisible turning of the stairs. �It�s Andrei!� thought Princess Marya. �No, it can�t be, it would be too extraordinary,� she thought, and the moment she thought it, the face and figure of Prince Andrei, in a fur coat with a snow-sprinkled collar, appeared on the landing where the servant stood with a candle. Yes, it was he, but pale and thin, with a changed, strangely softened, but anxious expression on his face. He came up the stairs and embraced his sister.

�You didn�t get my letter?� he asked, and, not waiting for an answer, which he would not have received, because the princess was unable to speak, he went back and, together with the accoucheur, who came in behind him (they had met at the last posting station), came upstairs again with quick steps, and again embraced his sister.

�What fate!� he said. �Masha, dear!� And, throwing off his fur coat and boots, he went to his wife�s rooms.


IX

The little princess lay propped on pillows, in a white cap (her suffering had just eased), locks of her black hair curled around her inflamed, sweaty cheeks; her rosy, lovely little mouth with its little lip covered with fine black hair was open, and she was smiling joyfully. Prince Andrei came into the room and stopped before her, at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying. Her glittering eyes, looking childishly frightened and anxious, rested on him without changing expression. �I love you all, I did no harm to anyone, why am I suffering? Help me,� her expression said. She saw her husband, but did not understand the meaning of his appearance before her. Prince Andrei went around the sofa and kissed her on the forehead.

�My darling!� he spoke words he had never said to her before. �God is merciful�� She looked at him questioningly with childlike reproach.

�I expected help from you, and there�s nothing, nothing�you, too!� said her eyes. She was not surprised that he had come; she did not understand that he had come. His coming had no relation to her suffering and its relief. The pain started again, and Marya Bogdanovna advised Prince Andrei to leave the room.

The accoucheur came in. Prince Andrei left, and, meeting Princess Marya, went up to her again. They spoke in whispers, but the conversation stopped every other minute. They waited and listened.

�Allez, mon ami,� said Princess Marya. Prince Andrei went to his wife again and sat in the next room waiting. Some woman came out of the room with a frightened face and became embarrassed on seeing Prince Andrei. He covered his face with his hands and sat that way for several minutes. Pitiful, helplessly animal moans came from behind the door. Prince Andrei got up, went to the door, and wanted to open it. Someone was holding the door.

�You mustn�t, you mustn�t!� a frightened voice said from inside. He started pacing the room. The cries ceased, another few seconds went by. Suddenly a terrible cry�not her cry, she could not cry like that�came from the next room. Prince Andrei rushed to the door; the cry ceased, but another cry was heard, a baby�s cry.

�Why did they bring a baby there?� was Prince Andrei�s first thought. �A baby? What baby?�Why is he there? Or has a baby been born?�

When he suddenly realized all the joyful meaning of that cry, tears choked him and, leaning both elbows on the windowsill, he wept, sobbing, as children weep. The door opened. The doctor, his shirtsleeves rolled up, without his frock coat, pale, his jaw trembling, came out of the room. Prince Andrei turned to him, but the doctor gave him a bewildered look and passed by without saying a word. A woman ran out, and, seeing Prince Andrei, hesitated in the doorway. He went into his wife�s room. She lay dead in the same position in which he had seen her five minutes before, and, despite her still eyes and pale cheeks, there was the same expression on that lovely, timid, childish face, with its lip covered with fine black hair.

�I loved you all and did nothing bad to anybody, and what have you done to me? Ah, what have you done to me?� said her lovely, pitiful, dead face. In the corner, something small and red snorted and squealed in Marya Bogdanovna�s white, trembling hands.

Two hours after that, Prince Andrei went into his father�s study with quiet steps. The old man already knew everything. He was standing just by the door, and as soon as it opened, the old man silently embraced his son�s neck with his old, tough arms, as in a vise, and burst into sobs like a child.

Three days later the funeral service was held for the little princess, and, in bidding farewell to her, Prince Andrei went up the steps to the coffin. She had the same face in the coffin, though her eyes were closed. �Ah, what have you done to me?� it kept saying, and Prince Andrei felt that something snapped in his soul, that he was to blame for something he could neither set aright nor forget. He was unable to weep. The old man also came and kissed her waxen little hand, which lay calmly over the other hand, and to him her face also said: �Ah, what is it that you have done to me and why?� And the old man turned angrily away on seeing that face.

After another five days, the young prince Nikolai Andreich was baptized. The foster mother held the swaddling clothes up with her chin, while the priest anointed the boy�s wrinkled red palms and feet with a goose feather.

The godfather�his grandfather�in fear of dropping him, shook as he carried the infant around the dented tin baptismal font, and then handed him to his godmother, Princess Marya. Prince Andrei, his heart sinking for fear they would drown the baby, sat in another room, waiting for the sacrament to be over. He looked joyfully at the baby when the nanny brought him out to him and nodded approvingly when the nanny told him that, when thrown into the font, the piece of wax with the baby�s hair had not sunk, but had floated in the font.

Rostov�s participation in the duel between Dolokhov and Bezukhov was hushed up through the efforts of the old count, and Rostov, instead of being demoted, as he expected, was appointed adjutant to the governor general of Moscow. As a result of that, he could not go to the country with the whole family, but remained in Moscow all summer with his new duties. Dolokhov recovered, and Rostov became especially close to him during the time of his convalescence. Dolokhov lay ill at his mother�s, who loved him passionately and tenderly. Old Marya Ivanovna came to love Rostov for his friendship with Fedya, and often spoke with him about her son.

�Yes, Count,� she used to say, �he�s too noble and pure-hearted for the depraved world of our time. No one loves virtue, it�s a sty in everyone�s eye. Now tell me, Count, was it fair, was it honest on Bezukhov�s part? Yet Fedya, in his nobility, loved him and never says anything bad about him even now. All that mischief with the policeman in Petersburg, some sort of fools� play, didn�t they do it together? Why, nothing happened to Bezukhov, and Fedya had to bear it all on his shoulders! He�s had to bear so much! Suppose they did restore him, but how could they not? I don�t think there were so many brave sons of the fatherland like him there. And now�this duel. Do these people have any feeling, any honor? To challenge him to a duel, knowing he�s an only son, and shoot straight at him! It�s a good thing God was merciful to us. And for what? Who in our time doesn�t have love affairs? Why, if he was so jealous�I can understand�then he should have let him feel it sooner, but no, it lasted a whole year. And so he challenged him to a duel, assuming that Fedya wouldn�t fight because he owed him money. How mean! How vile! I know you�ve understood Fedya, my dear count, that�s why I love you from the heart, believe me. Few people understand him. He�s such a lofty, heavenly soul��

Dolokhov himself, during his convalescence, often spoke such words to Rostov as he could never have expected from him.

�People consider me a wicked man, I know,� he used to say, �and let them. I don�t care about anyone except those I love; but those I love, I love so much that I�d give my life for them, and the rest I�d crush if they stood in my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother, two or three friends, you among them, and to the rest I pay attention only insofar as they�re useful or harmful. And almost all of them are harmful, especially women. Yes, my dear heart,� he went on, �I have met loving, noble, lofty men; but I have never yet met any women who weren�t bought�whether countesses or kitchen maids. I have never yet met that heavenly purity and faithfulness that I seek in a woman. If I had ever found such a woman, I would have given my life for her. But these!�� He made a gesture of contempt. �And believe me, if I still value my life, it�s only because I still hope to meet the heavenly being who will resurrect, purify, and elevate me. But you don�t understand that.�

�No, I understand very well,� replied Rostov, who was under the influence of his new friend.

In the fall the Rostov family returned to Moscow. At the beginning of winter, Denisov also returned and stayed with the Rostovs. This early wintertime of 1806 that Nikolai Rostov spent in Moscow was one of the happiest and merriest for him and his whole family. Nikolai attracted many young men to his parents� house. Vera was a beautiful twenty-year-old girl; Sonya a sixteen-year-old, with all the loveliness of a just-opened flower; Natasha, half young lady, half child, now childishly funny, now girlishly bewitching.

At that time there was a special atmosphere of amorousness in the Rostovs� house, as happens in a house where there are very nice and very young girls. Every young man who came to the Rostovs� house, looking at these young, susceptible girlish faces, always smiling at something (probably their own happiness), at this lively rushing about, listening to this young female babble, incoherent, but affectionate towards everyone, ready for anything, filled with hope, listening to these incoherent noises, now of singing, now of music, experienced the same feeling of readiness for love and expectation of happiness that these young people of the Rostovs� house themselves experienced.

Among the young men introduced by Rostov, one of the first was Dolokhov, whom everyone in the house liked with the exception of Natasha. She almost quarreled with her brother over Dolokhov. She insisted that he was a wicked man, that, in his duel with Bezukhov, Pierre had been right and Dolokhov wrong, that he was unpleasant and unnatural.

�There�s nothing for me to understand!� Natasha cried with stubborn willfulness. �He�s wicked and unfeeling. I do like your Denisov, and he�s a carouser and all that, but even so I like him, which means I understand. I don�t know how to tell you; he has it all calculated, and I don�t like that. But Denisov��

�Well, Denisov�s something else,� replied Nikolai, making it clear that, compared with Dolokhov, even Denisov was nothing, �you should understand what a soul Dolokhov has, you should see him with his mother, he has such a heart!�

�Well, that I don�t know, but I feel awkward with him. And do you know that he�s in love with Sonya?�

�What silliness��

�I�m certain, you�ll see.�

Natasha�s prediction was proving true. Dolokhov, who did not like the society of women, began to frequent their house, and the question of whom he was doing it for was soon resolved (though no one spoke of it), in the sense that he was doing it for Sonya. And Sonya knew it, though she would never have dared to say it, and she flushed crimson every time Dolokhov appeared.

Dolokhov dined frequently with the Rostovs, never missed a play when they went, and attended the balls for adolescentes at Iogel�s, where the Rostovs always went. He paid most attention to Sonya and looked at her with such eyes that not only was she unable to endure that gaze without turning red, but even the old countess and Natasha blushed when they noticed it.

It was clear that this strong, strange man was under the irresistible influence produced on him by this dark-haired, graceful girl who loved another.

Rostov noticed something new between Dolokhov and Sonya; but he did not define for himself what these new relations were. �They�re all in love with somebody,� he thought about Sonya and Natasha. But he now felt less at ease with Sonya and Dolokhov, and he began to stay away from home more often.

With the fall of 1806, everyone again began talking about war with Napoleon, with still greater ardor than the previous year. A recruitment was announced, not only of ten recruits, but of another nine fighting men per thousand. Bonapartius was anathematized everywhere, and around Moscow the only talk was of the impending war. For the Rostov family, all the interest of these preparations for war consisted only in the fact that Nikolushka absolutely refused to remain in Moscow and was simply waiting for the end of Denisov�s leave in order to go with him to their regiment after the holidays. The impending departure not only did not hinder his merrymaking, but even encouraged it. He spent most of the time away from home, at dinners, evening parties, and balls.


XI

On the third day of Christmas, Nikolai dined at home, which had rarely happened with him recently. This was an official farewell dinner, because he and Denisov would be leaving for their regiment after Epiphany. There were some twenty guests at dinner, Dolokhov and Denisov among them.

Never had the amorous air in the Rostovs� house, the atmosphere of being in love, manifested itself so strongly as during these festive days. �Seize the moments of happiness, make them love you, fall in love yourself! That is the only real thing in this world�the rest is all nonsense. And that is the one thing we�re taken up with here,� said this atmosphere.

Nikolai, as always, having exhausted two pairs of horses and still not having managed to get to all the places he had to go and to which he had been invited, came home just before dinner. As soon as he came in, he noticed and felt the intensity of the amorous atmosphere in the house; but besides that, he noticed a strange perplexity prevailing among certain members of the company. Sonya, Dolokhov, and the old countess were especially perplexed, and Natasha somewhat. Nikolai realized that something must have happened before dinner between Sonya and Dolokhov, and with a sensitivity of heart all his own, he treated them both very delicately and carefully during dinner. That same evening of the third day of the feast one of those balls was to take place that Iogel (a dancing master) gave during the holidays for all his pupils, boys and girls.

�Will you go to Iogel�s, Nikolenka? Please do,� Natasha said to him, �he has asked you specially, and Vassily Dmitrich (that is, Denisov) is going.�

�I�ll go anywhere the countess orders me to!� said Denisov, who had jokingly placed himself on the footing of Natasha�s knight in the Rostovs� house. �I�m ready to dance the pas de ch&#226;le.�

�If I have time! I promised to be at the Arkharovs� soir&#233;e,� said Nikolai. �And you?�� he turned to Dolokhov. And as soon as he asked it, he noticed that he should not have asked.

�Yes, perhaps�� Dolokhov answered coldly and angrily, glancing at Sonya, and, frowning, he glanced at Nikolai exactly as he had looked at Pierre during the club dinner.

�There�s something here,� thought Nikolai and, still more convinced of his conjecture by Dolokhov�s departure right after dinner, he called Natasha out and asked what it was.

�And I�ve been looking for you,� said Natasha, running out to him. �I kept saying it, and you refused to believe me,� she said triumphantly. �He proposed to Sonya.�

Little as Nikolai had been occupied with Sonya during that time, it was as if something snapped in him when he heard it. Dolokhov was a decent and in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless orphan Sonya. From the point of view of the old countess and of society, it was impossible to refuse him. And therefore Nikolai�s first feeling when he heard it was anger at Sonya. He was preparing to say: �Splendid, and of course she must forget her childish promises and accept the proposal� but before he had time to say it�

�Can you imagine! She refused him, refused him altogether!� said Natasha. �She said she loved another,� she added after a brief pause.

�Yes, my Sonya couldn�t have acted otherwise!� thought Nikolai.

�No matter how much mama begged her, she refused, and I know she won�t change once she�s said something��

�And mama begged her!� Nikolai said with reproach.

�Yes,� said Natasha. �You see, Nikolenka, don�t be angry, but I know you won�t marry her. I know, God knows how, but I know for certain that you won�t marry her.�

�Well, that you really can�t know,� said Nikolai, �but I must speak with her. What a delight this Sonya is!� he added, smiling.

�She is a delight! I�ll send her to you.� And Natasha, having kissed her brother, ran off.

A moment later, Sonya came in, frightened, bewildered, and guilty. Nikolai went up to her and kissed her hand. It was the first time during his visit that they spoke alone and about their love.

�Sophie,� he said, timidly at first, then more and more boldly, �if you want to refuse not only a brilliant but an advantageous match; but he�s a wonderful, noble man�he�s my friend��

Sonya interrupted him.

�I�ve already refused,� she said hurriedly.

�If you�ve refused for my sake, I�m afraid I��

Sonya interrupted him again. She looked at him with a pleading, frightened gaze.

�Nicolas, don�t say that to me,� she said.

�No, I must. Maybe it�s suffisance on my part, but it�s still better to say everything. If you refused for my sake, I must tell you the whole truth. I love you, I think, more than anyone��

�That�s enough for me,� Sonya said, blushing.

�No, but I have fallen in love and will fall in love a thousand times, though I have no such feeling of friendship, trust, and love for anyone but you. Besides, I�m young. Maman doesn�t want it. Well, simply, I don�t promise anything. And I ask you to think about Dolokhov�s proposal,� he said, speaking his friend�s name with difficulty.

�Don�t say that to me. I don�t want anything. I love you as a brother, and will love you always, and I need nothing more.�

�You�re an angel, I�m not worthy of you, only I�m afraid to deceive you.� And Nikolai kissed her hand once more.

The balls at Iogel�s were the merriest in Moscow. Mothers said so, looking at their adolescentes performing their just-learned pas; the adolescentes and adolescents said so themselves, dancing until they dropped; grownup girls and young men said so, who came to these balls thinking they were condescending and found the best of merriment in them. That year two matches were made at these balls. The two pretty Gorchakov princesses found fianc&#233;s and got married, and this added still more to the reputation of these balls. The particuliarity of these balls was that there was no host or hostess; there was the good-natured Iogel, scraping the parquet by all the rules of art, flitting about like a bit of down, receiving tickets for lessons from his pupils; another thing was that only those came to these balls who wanted to dance and be merry, the way thirteen- and fourteen-year-old girls do, who put on long gowns for the first time. All of them, with rare exceptions, were or seemed pretty: so rapturously they smiled, so lit-up were their eyes. Sometimes the best girl pupils even danced the pas de ch&#226;le, and the best of them was Natasha, distinguished by her gracefulness; but at this last ball only the &#233;cossaise and the anglaise were danced, and the mazurka, which was just coming into fashion. Iogel rented the ballroom in Bezukhov�s house, and the ball was very successful, as everyone said. There were many pretty girls, and the Rostov girls were among the best. They were both especially happy and gay that evening. Sonya, proud of Dolokhov�s proposal, of her refusal, and of the talk with Nikolai, started twirling while she was still at home, not letting her maid do up her braids, and now she shone all through with impetuous joy.

Natasha, no less proud of wearing a long gown for the first time, at a real ball, was still happier. The two girls wore white muslin gowns with pink ribbons.

Natasha fell in love from the moment she entered the ballroom. She was not in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone. She fell in love with whomever she looked at, the moment she looked at him.

�Ah, how nice!� she kept saying, running to Sonya.

Nikolai and Denisov walked around the rooms, looking at the dancers benignly and patronizingly.

�How pretty she is, she�ll be a beauty,� said Denisov.

�Who?�

�Countess Natasha,� replied Denisov. �And how well she dances, what race!� he said again, after some silence.

�Who are you talking about?�

�Your sister,� Denisov cried angrily.

Rostov smiled.

�Mon cher comte, vous &#234;tes l�un de mes meilleurs &#233;coliers, il faut que vous dansiez,� said little Iogel, coming over to Nikolai. �Voyez combien de jolies demoiselles.� He turned with the same request to Denisov, who was also his former pupil.

�Non, mon cher, je ferai tapisserie,� said Denisov. �Don�t you remember what poor use I made of your lessons?�

�Oh, no!� Iogel hastened to reassure him. �You were merely inattentive, but you had the ability, yes, you had the ability.�

They began to play the newly fashionable mazurka. Nikolai could not refuse Iogel and asked Sonya to dance. Denisov sat down with the old ladies, and, his elbow propped on his saber, his foot beating time, told some merry story and made the old ladies laugh, while glancing at the dancing young people. Iogel danced in the lead couple with Natasha, his pride and his best pupil. Moving his feet softly, delicately, in his little boots, Iogel flew down the ballroom with Natasha, who timidly but carefully performed her pas. Denisov�s eyes were fixed on her, and he beat time with an air which said clearly that he was not dancing himself only because he did not want to, not because he could not. In the middle of a figure, he called out to Rostov, who was just passing by.

�That�s not it at all,� he said. �Is that a Polish mazurka? But she dances splendidly.�

Knowing that Denisov was famous even in Poland for his skill in dancing the Polish mazurka, Nikolai ran over to Natasha.

�Go and choose Denisov. You should see him dance! It�s a wonder!� he said.

When Natasha�s turn came again, she got up and, stepping quickly in her beribboned little shoes, she timidly ran alone across the room to the corner where Denisov was sitting. She saw that everyone was looking at her and waiting. Nikolai saw that Denisov and Natasha were having a smiling argument, and that Denisov was protesting but smiling joyfully. He ran over.

�Please, Vassily Dmitrich,� Natasha said, �please do.�

�No, really. Spare me, Countess,� said Denisov.

�Enough, now, Vasya,� said Nikolai.

�He talks to me like Vaska the cat,� Denisov said jokingly.

�I�ll sing for you all evening,� said Natasha.

�The sorceress, she does whatever she likes with me!� said Denisov, and he unbuckled his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, took his lady firmly by the hand, threw back his head, and advanced his foot, waiting for the downbeat. Only on horseback and in the mazurka did Denisov�s small stature not show, and he looked like the fine fellow he felt himself to be. On the downbeat, he gave his lady a victorious and jocular sidelong look, unexpectedly stamped his foot, bounced off the floor springily, like a ball, and flew along in a circle, drawing his lady after him. He flew inaudibly across half the room on one leg, and, seeming not to see the chairs that stood before him, raced straight for them; but suddenly, clanking his spurs and spreading his legs, he stopped on his heels, paused like that for a second, tapped his feet in place with a clanking of spurs, spun quickly, then, tapping his right ankle with his left foot, again flew along in a circle. Natasha intuitively guessed what he was about to do and, not knowing how herself, followed him�giving herself to him. Now he twirled her on his right arm, now on his left, now he fell on his knees and led her around him, then jumped up and sped on as precipitously as if he intended to run through all the rooms without pausing for breath; now he suddenly stopped again and performed a new and unexpected caper. When he swiftly twirled his lady in front of her seat and jingled his spurs before her as he bowed, Natasha did not even curtsey to him. She fixed her eyes on him in perplexity, smiling as though she did not recognize him.

�What on earth is this?� she said.

Even though Iogel did not acknowledge this mazurka as authentic, everyone admired Denisov�s skill, began choosing him constantly, and the old men, smiling, began to talk about Poland and the good old days. Denisov, flushed from the mazurka and wiping himself with a handkerchief, sat down by Natasha and did not leave her for the whole ball.


XIII

For two days after that, Rostov did not see Dolokhov at his house and could not find him at home; on the third day, he received a note from him.

�Since I do not intend to frequent your house anymore, for reasons known to you, and am leaving for the army, tonight I am giving a farewell party for my friends�come to the English Hotel.� That evening, after nine o�clock, Rostov went to the English Hotel from the theater, where he had been with his family and Denisov. He was brought at once to the best rooms of the hotel, taken for the night by Dolokhov.

Some twenty men crowded around the table at which Dolokhov sat between two candles. On the table lay gold and banknotes, and Dolokhov kept the bank. Nikolai had not seen Dolokhov since his proposal and Sonya�s refusal, and he felt embarrassed at the thought of how they would meet.

Dolokhov�s light, cold gaze met Rostov at the door, as if he had long been waiting for him.

�We haven�t seen each other for long time,� he said. �Thank you for coming. Let me just finish the game, and Ilyushka will come with the chorus.�

�I called at your place,� Rostov said, blushing.

Dolokhov did not reply.

�You can stake,� he said.

Rostov remembered at that moment a strange conversation he had once had with Dolokhov. �Only fools can gamble on luck,� Dolokhov had said then.

�Or are you afraid to play with me?� Dolokhov said now, as if guessing Rostov�s thought, and he smiled. Behind his smile, Rostov saw in him that mood he had been in during the dinner at the club and generally at those times when, bored with everyday life, Dolokhov felt the necessity of getting out of it by some strange, most often cruel, act.

Rostov felt awkward; he sought and could not find in his mind a joke which would reply to Dolokhov�s words. But, before he managed to do it, Dolokhov, looking straight in Rostov�s face, said to him, slowly and measuredly, so that everyone could hear:

�Remember, we talked once about gambling�he�s a fool who wants to gamble on luck; gambling needs certainty, but I want to try it.�

�Try gambling on luck or on certainty?� Rostov wondered.

�But you�d better not gamble,� Dolokhov added, and, flexing a newly opened deck, he said: �Bank, gentlemen!�

Moving money forward, Dolokhov prepared to keep the bank. Rostov sat beside him and at first did not play. Dolokhov kept glancing at him.

�Why aren�t you playing?� said Dolokhov. And, strangely, Nikolai felt the need to take a card, stake an insignificant sum on it, and begin to play.

�I have no money with me,� said Rostov.

�I�ll trust you!�

Rostov staked five roubles and lost, staked once more and lost again. Dolokhov �killed��that is, won�ten cards in a row from Rostov.

�Gentlemen,� he said, after keeping the bank for a while, �I ask you to put your money on your cards, otherwise I may get confused in the accounting.�

One of the players said he had hoped he could be trusted.

�That I can do, but I�m afraid to get confused; I ask you to put money on the cards,� replied Dolokhov. �And don�t you be shy, we�ll settle our accounts,� he added, turning to Rostov.

The game went on; a servant constantly went around with champagne.

All of Rostov�s cards were beaten, and eight hundred roubles were already scored against him. He wrote eight hundred rubles on a card, but, while champagne was served to him, he changed his mind and again wrote an ordinary stake, twenty rubles.

�Leave it,� said Dolokhov, though it seemed he was not even looking at Rostov, �you�ll win it back the sooner. I let the others win, but you I beat. Or are you afraid of me?� he repeated.

Rostov obeyed, left the eight hundred as written and laid down a seven of hearts with a torn corner that he had picked up from the floor. He remembered it very well afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts and wrote eight hundred above it with a piece of chalk in round, straight figures; drank the glass of now warm champagne that had been served him, smiled at Dolokhov�s words, and, waiting with sinking heart for a seven, began watching Dolokhov�s hands which held the deck. The winning or losing of this seven meant a lot to Rostov. Last Sunday, Count Ilya Andreich had given his son two thousand rubles, and he, who never liked to talk about money problems, had told him that this money was the last until May and that he therefore asked his son to be more economical this time. Nikolai had said that it was even too much for him and on his word of honor he would not ask for more money until spring. He now had twelve hundred rubles of that money left. Therefore the seven of hearts meant not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of breaking his word. With sinking heart he watched Dolokhov�s hands and thought: �Well, be quick, deal me the card, and I�ll take my cap and go home to have supper with Denisov, Natasha, and Sonya, and will certainly never touch cards again.� At that moment his life at home�jokes with Petya, talks with Sonya, duets with Natasha, piquet with his father, and even his quiet bed in the house on Povarskaya�presented itself to him with such force, clarity, and delight, as though it were all a long past, lost, and unappreciated happiness. He could not imagine that stupid chance, making the seven fall to the right rather than the left, could deprive him of all this newly understood, newly illumined happiness and cast him into an abyss of as yet unexperienced and undefined misfortune. It could not be, but even so he waited with sinking heart for the movement of Dolokhov�s hands. Those broad-boned, reddish hands, with hair showing from under the cuffs, set down the deck of cards and took the glass and pipe that had been served him.

�So you�re not afraid to gamble with me?� Dolokhov repeated, and, as if in order to tell a merry story, he set the cards down, leaned back in his chair, and, with a smile, slowly began to speak:

�Yes, gentlemen, I�ve been told there�s a rumor going around Moscow that I�m a cardsharper, so I advise you to be more careful with me.�

�Well, deal then!� said Rostov.

�Ah, these Moscow gossips!� said Dolokhov, and he picked up the cards with a smile.

�Ahh!� Rostov nearly cried, seizing his hair with both hands. The seven he needed was lying on top, the first card in the deck. He had lost more than he could pay.

�Don�t overdo it, though,� said Dolokhov, with a fleeting glance at Rostov, and he went on dealing.


XIV

An hour and a half later, most of the players looked upon their own game as a joke.

The whole game was concentrated on Rostov alone. Instead of sixteen hundred roubles, he had a long column of figures scored against him, which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but which by now, as he dimly supposed, had already risen to fifteen thousand. In fact, the score already exceeded twenty thousand roubles. Dolokhov no longer listened or told stories; he watched every movement of Rostov�s hands and from time to time glanced quickly through his score. He had decided to continue playing until the score grew to forty-three thousand. He had chosen this number because forty-three made up the sum of his age plus Sonya�s. Rostov, his head propped in both hands, sat at the written-on, wine-stained, card-strewn table. One tormenting impression would not leave him: those broad-boned, reddish hands, with hair showing from under the cuffs, those hands which he loved and hated, and which held him in their power.

�Six hundred roubles, ace, corner, nine�I can�t win it all back!�And how cheerful it would be at home�A jack, ah, no�it can�t be!�And why is he doing this to me?�� Rostov thought and tried to recall. Occasionally he staked a large sum, but Dolokhov refused to play and set the stake himself. Nikolai obeyed him, and first he prayed to God as he had prayed during the battle on the Amstetten bridge; then he decided that the first card that came to hand from the pile of bent cards under the table would be the one to save him; then he counted the cords on his jacket and chose the card with the same number to stake against his entire loss; then he looked at the other players for help; then he peered into the now cold face of Dolokhov and tried to figure out what was going on in him.

�He does know what this loss means to me,� he said to himself. �Can he really wish for my ruin? He used to be my friend. I loved him�But it�s not his fault either; what can he do if he�s in luck? Nor is it my fault,� he said to himself. �I�ve done nothing wrong. Did I kill anyone, insult or wish evil to anyone? Why, then, such a terrible misfortune? And when did it start? Just now, when I came to this table, wishing to win a hundred roubles to buy that sewing box for mama�s birthday and go home, I was so happy, so free, so cheerful! And I didn�t realize then how happy I was! When did it end, and when did this new, terrible condition begin? What marked the change? I kept sitting in the same way in this place, at this table, choosing cards and playing them, and watching those broad-boned, deft hands. When did it happen, and what has happened? I�m healthy, strong, I�m the same and in the same place. No, it can�t be! Surely it will all come to nothing.�

He was red, all in a sweat, though it was not hot in the room. And his face was frightful and pitiful, especially in its impotent desire to seem calm.

The score reached the fateful number of forty-three thousand. Rostov prepared a card which was to go corners on the three thousand just given him, when Dolokhov tapped the deck on the table, set it aside, and, taking the chalk, quickly began in his clear, strong hand, breaking the piece of chalk, to add up Rostov�s score.

�Supper, time for supper! The Gypsies are here!� Indeed, some dark-haired men and women, saying something with a Gypsy accent, were already coming in from the cold. Nikolai knew it was all over, but he said in an indifferent voice:

�So you won�t go on? And I had a nice card ready.� As if he was most interested in the amusement of the game itself.

�It�s all over, I�m lost!� he thought. �A bullet in the head is all that�s left to me,� and at the same time he said in a cheerful voice:

�Well, one more little card.�

�All right,� said Dolokhov, having finished reckoning, �all right! I�ll go twenty-one roubles,� he said, pointing to the difference of twenty-one roubles over the exact sum of forty-three thousand, and, taking the deck, prepared to deal. Rostov obediently unbent the corner and, instead of the six thousand he had prepared, carefully wrote twenty-one.

�It�s all the same to me,� he said. �I�m just curious to know whether you�ll kill this ten or let me win it.�

Dolokhov gravely began to deal. Oh, how Rostov hated at that moment those reddish hands, with their short fingers and the hair sticking out from the cuffs, which had him in their power�He won the ten.

�You owe me forty-three thousand, Count,� said Dolokhov, and he stood up from the table and stretched. �It�s tiring, though, to sit so long,� he said.

�Yes, I�m tired, too,� said Rostov.

Dolokhov, as if to remind him that it was unsuitable for him to joke, interrupted him:

�When will I get the money, Count, if you please?�

Rostov flushed and invited Dolokhov to another room.

�I can�t pay it all, I suppose you�ll accept a promissory note,� he said.

�Listen, Rostov,� said Dolokhov, smiling brightly and looking into Nikolai�s eyes, �you know the saying, �Lucky in love, unlucky at cards.� Your cousin�s in love with you. I know it.�

�Oh! it�s terrible to feel myself so much in this man�s power,� thought Rostov. Rostov knew what a blow he would deal to his father, to his mother, in announcing this loss; he knew what happiness it would be to be delivered of it all, and he realized that Dolokhov knew he could deliver him from this shame and grief, but still wanted to play with him as a cat plays with a mouse.

�Your cousin�� Dolokhov tried to begin; but Nikolai interrupted him.

�My cousin has nothing to do with it, and there is no point in talking about her!� he cried in a rage.

�So when will I get it?� asked Dolokhov.

�Tomorrow,� Rostov said and left the room.


XV

To say �tomorrow� and keep up the tone of propriety was not difficult, but to come home alone, to see his sisters, brother, mother, father, to confess and ask for money to which he had no right after giving his word of honor, was terrible.

At home no one was asleep. The young people of the Rostovs� house, having come back from the theater and had supper, were sitting by the clavichord. As soon as Nikolai came into the reception room, he was enveloped by that amorous, poetic atmosphere which had prevailed in their house that winter and which now, after Dolokhov�s proposal and Iogel�s ball, seemed to thicken still more, like the air before a thunderstorm, over Sonya and Natasha. Sonya and Natasha, in the light blue dresses they had worn to the theater, pretty and knowing it, happy, smiling, stood by the clavichord. Vera and Shinshin were playing chess in the drawing room. The old countess, waiting for her son and husband, was playing patience with an old gentlewoman who lived in their house. Denisov, eyes shining and hair disheveled, was sitting, his leg thrust back, at the clavichord, banging out chords on it with his stubby fingers and, his eyes rolling, was singing in his small, hoarse, but true voice some verses of his own composition, �The Sorceress,� which he was trying to set to music.


Sorceress, tell me by what art

Thou drawest me to abandoned strings;

What fire has thou instilled in my heart,

What rapture through my fingers sings!


he sang in a passionate voice, his agate-black eyes flashing at the frightened and happy Natasha.

�Splendid! Excellent!� cried Natasha. �Another stanza,� she said, not noticing Nikolai.

�For them everything�s the same,� thought Nikolai, peeking into the drawing room, where he saw Vera and his mother with the little old lady.

�Ah! here�s Nikolenka!� Natasha ran over to him.

�Is papa at home?� he asked.

�I�m so glad you�ve come!� Natasha said without replying. �We�re having such fun! Vassily Dmitrich is staying one more day for my sake, you know!�

�No, papa hasn�t come yet,� said Sonya.

�Coco, you�re home, come here to me, my dearest,� the countess�s voice came from the drawing room. Nikolai went over to his mother, kissed her hand, silently sat down at her table, and began watching her hands, which were laying out cards. From the reception room came laughter and merry voices persuading Natasha.

�Well, all right, all right,� cried Denisov, �now there�s no getting out of it, you owe us a barcarolle, I beg you.�

The countess glanced at her silent son.

�What�s the matter?� the mother asked Nikolai.

�Oh, nothing,� he said, as if he was already sick of this one and the same question. �Will papa come soon?�

�I think so.�

�For them everything�s the same. They don�t know anything! What am I to do with myself?� thought Nikolai, and he went back to the reception room, where the clavichord stood.

Sonya was sitting at the clavichord and playing the prelude to the barcarolle that Denisov especially liked. Natasha was preparing to sing. Denisov was looking at her with rapturous eyes.

Nikolai began pacing up and down the room.

�Why on earth make her sing! What can she sing? There�s no fun in it at all,� thought Nikolai.

Sonya played the first chord of the prelude.

�My God, I�m a dishonest, lost man. A bullet in the head is all that�s left for me, not singing,� he thought. �Go away? but where? Never mind, let them sing!�

Nikolai, continuing to pace the room, glanced gloomily at Denisov and the girls, avoiding their eyes.

�Nikolenka, what�s the matter with you?� asked Sonya�s eyes, turned to him. She saw at once that something had happened to him.

Nikolai turned away from her. Natasha, with her sensitivity, also instantly noticed her brother�s state. She noticed it, but she felt so merry herself at that moment, she was so far from grief, sorrow, reproach, that she purposely deceived herself (as often happens with young people). �No, I�m too merry now to spoil my merriment by sympathy for someone else�s grief,� she felt and said to herself: �No, I�m surely mistaken, he must be as merry as I am.�

�Well, Sonya,� she said, and went out to the very middle of the reception room, where, in her opinion, the resonance was best. Raising her head, lowering her lifelessly hanging arms as dancers do, Natasha made a few energetic steps from heel to toe in the middle of the room and stopped.

�Here I am!� she seemed to be saying, responding to the rapturous gaze of Denisov, who was watching her.

�What�s she so glad about!� thought Nikolai, looking at his sister. �How is it she�s not bored and ashamed!� Natasha took the first note, her throat expanded, her chest straightened, her eyes acquired a serious expression. She did not think of anyone or anything at that moment, and from her lips composed into a smile sounds poured forth, sounds that anyone can produce for the same lengths of time, at the same intervals, but which leave one cold a thousand times, then for the thousand and first time make one tremble and weep.

That winter Natasha had begun to sing seriously for the first time, especially because Denisov admired her singing. She no longer sang like a child, there was none of that comic, childish assiduousness in her singing which had been in it before; but her singing was not good yet, as all the critical connoisseurs said who had heard her sing. �Her voice has no polish, it�s beautiful, but it needs polish,� they all said. But they usually said it long after her voice had fallen silent. While this unpolished voice with its wrong breathing and strained transitions was singing, even the critical connoisseurs said nothing and merely enjoyed this unpolished voice, merely wanted to hear it again. Her voice had that virgin, intact quality, that unawareness of its strength, that unpolished velvetiness, which were so combined with a deficiency in the art of singing that it seemed impossible to change anything in this voice without spoiling it.

�What on earth is this?� thought Nikolai, hearing her voice and opening his eyes wide. �What�s happened with her? How she sings today!� he thought. And suddenly the whole world became concentrated for him on the expectation of the next note, the next phrase, and everything in the world became divided into three beats: �Oh mio crudele affetto� One, two, three�one, two�three�one�Oh mio crudele affetto�One, two, three�one. Ah, our foolish life!� thought Nikolai. �All this misfortune, and money, and Dolokhov, and spite, and honor�it�s all nonsense�and here is�the real thing�Ah, Natasha, ah, darling! ah, dearest!�How is she going to take this B�She did it? Thank God!� And without noticing it, he himself was singing, so as to strengthen that B, taking the second voice a third below the high note. �My God! how beautiful! Did I sing that? What happiness!� he thought.

Oh, how that third had vibrated, and how touched was something that was best in Rostov�s soul. And that something was independent of anything in the world and higher than anything in the world. What are gambling losses, and Dolokhovs, and words of honor!�It�s all nonsense! One can kill, and steal, and still be happy�


XVI

It was long since Rostov had experienced such enjoyment from music as on that day. But as soon as Natasha finished her barcarolle, reality again reminded him of itself. Saying nothing, he left and went downstairs to his room. A quarter of an hour later, the old count, merry and content, came home from the club. Nikolai, hearing him come, went to him.

�Well, did you have a good time?� asked Ilya Andreich, smiling joyfully and proudly at his son. Nikolai wanted to say �yes,� but could not: he all but burst into sobs. The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son�s state.

�Eh, it�s inevitable!� Nikolai thought for the first and last time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him seem vile to himself, as if he was asking for a carriage in order to go to town, he said to his father:

�Papa, I�ve come on business. I nearly forgot. I need money.�

�Well, now,� said his father, who was in an especially cheerful mood. �I told you it wouldn�t be enough. How much?�

�Very much,� said Nikolai, blushing and with a stupid, casual smile for which he could not forgive himself for a long time afterwards. �I�ve lost a bit at cards, that is, a good deal, even a very great deal, forty-three thousand.�

�What? To whom?�You�re joking!� the count cried, his neck and nape suddenly turning an apoplectic red, as happens with old people.

�I promised to pay tomorrow,� said Nikolai.

�Well!�� said the old count, spreading his arms and sinking strengthlessly onto the sofa.

�No help for it! It happens to everybody,� his son said in a careless, brazen tone, while in his soul he considered himself a villain, a scoundrel, whose whole life would not be enough to redeem his crime. He would have liked to kiss his father�s hands, to go to his knees and ask forgiveness, yet he said in a careless and even rude tone that it happened to everybody.

Hearing his son�s words, Count Ilya Andreich lowered his eyes and began fussing about, as if looking for something.

�Yes, yes,� he said, �it�s hard, I�m afraid it�s hard to find�it happens! Yes, it happens to everybody�� And, giving his son a fleeting look, the count started out of the room�Nikolai had been prepared for a rebuff, but he had never expected this�

�Papa! Pa�pa!� he cried out after him, sobbing, �forgive me!� And, seizing his father�s hand, he pressed his lips to it and wept.

While father and son were having a talk, a no less important talk was going on between mother and daughter. Natasha, excited, had come running to her mother.

�Mama!�Mama!�He��

�He what?�

�He, he proposed to me. Mama! Mama!� she cried.

The countess could not believe her ears. Denisov had proposed. To whom? To this tiny little girl, Natasha, who still recently was playing with dolls and was having lessons even now.

�Natasha, enough of this silliness!� she said, still hoping it was a joke.

�Well, there�silliness! I�m telling you a real thing,� Natasha said crossly. �I come to ask you what to do, and you say �silliness���

The countess shrugged her shoulders.

�If it�s true that Monsieur Denisov has proposed to you, ridiculous as it is, tell him he�s a fool, that�s all.�

�No, he�s not a fool,� Natasha said in an offended and serious tone.

�Well, what do you want, then? You�re all in love these days. Well, if you�re in love, marry him,� the countess said, laughing crossly. �God help you!�

�No, mama, I�m not in love with him, it must be I�m not in love with him.�

�Well, then tell him so.�

�Mama, are you cross? Don�t be cross, dearest, is it my fault?�

�No, but what then, my dear? Would you like me to go and tell him?� the countess said, smiling.

�No, I�ll do it, only teach me how. Everything�s so easy for you,� she added, responding to her smile. �If you�d seen how he said it to me! Oh, I know he didn�t want to say it, but just said it by accident.�

�Well, even so you must refuse him.�

�No, I mustn�t. I�m so sorry for him! He�s so nice.�

�Well, then accept his proposal. It�s really time you were married,� her mother said crossly and mockingly.

�No, mama, I�m so sorry for him. I don�t know how to tell him.�

�There�s no need for you to tell him, I�ll tell him myself,� said the countess, indignant that someone had dared to consider her little Natasha a grownup.

�No, not for anything, I�ll do it, and you go and listen at the door.� And Natasha ran across the drawing room to the reception room, where Denisov was sitting on the same chair at the clavichord, covering his face with his hands. At the sound of her light footsteps, he jumped up.

�Natalie,� he said, going to her with quick steps, �decide my fate. It is in your hands!�

�Vassily Dmitrich, I�m so sorry for you!�No, but you�re so nice�but you mustn�t�that�but I�ll always love you like this.�

Denisov bent over her hand, and she heard strange, incomprehensible sounds. She kissed him on his black, tousled, curly head. At that moment there was a hasty rustle of the countess�s skirts. She went up to them.

�Vassily Dmitrich, I thank you for the honor,� the countess said in an embarrassed tone, which seemed stern to Denisov, �but my daughter is so young, and I thought that you, as my son�s friend, would have addressed me first. In that case, you would not have brought me to the necessity of a refusal.�

�Countess�� said Denisov, with lowered eyes and a guilty look, and he was about to say something more, but faltered.

Natasha could not calmly see him so pitiful. She began to sob loudly.

�Countess, I am to blame before you,� Denisov went on in a halting voice. �But know that I adore your daughter and your whole family so much that I would give two lives�� He looked at the countess and, noticing her stern face��Good-bye, Countess,� he said, kissed her hand, and, without looking at Natasha, with quick, resolute steps, left the room.

The next day Rostov saw off Denisov, who did not want to remain in Moscow a day longer. All Denisov�s Moscow friends were seeing him off at the Gypsies�, and he did not remember how he was put in the sleigh and driven the first three posting stations.

After Denisov�s departure, Rostov, waiting for the money, which the old count could not raise all at once, spent two more weeks in Moscow without leaving the house, mostly in the young ladies� room.

Sonya was more devoted and tender to him than ever. It was as if she wanted to show him that his loss at cards was a feat which made her love him still more; but Nikolai now considered himself unworthy of her.

He covered the girls� albums with verses and music, and, without taking leave of any of his acquaintances, having finally sent off the entire forty-three thousand and received Dolokhov�s receipt, left at the end of November to catch up with his regiment, which was already in Poland.



��������� Part Two ���������


I

After his talk with his wife, Pierre went to Petersburg. At the Torzhok posting station there were no horses, or else the postmaster did not want to give them to him. Pierre had to wait. Without undressing, he lay down on a leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big feet in their warm boots on the table, and lapsed into thought.

�Would you like to have the suitcases brought in? Would you like to have the bed made, or tea served?� asked his valet.

Pierre did not reply, because he heard and saw nothing. He had lapsed into thought at the previous station and went on thinking about the same thing�so important that he paid no attention to what was happening around him. He not only was not interested in whether he would get to Petersburg sooner or later, or whether he would or would not find a place to rest in this station, but, compared with the thoughts that occupied him then, it was all the same to him whether he spent a few hours or his whole life in this station.

The postmaster, his wife, the valet, a peasant woman with Torzhok embroidery kept coming into the room, offering their services. Pierre, not changing the position of his raised legs, looked at them through his spectacles without understanding what they could possibly want or how they could possibly live without resolving the questions that occupied him. And he had been occupied with the same questions ever since the day when he came back from Sokolniki after the duel and spent the first tormenting, sleepless night; only now, in the solitude of the journey, they came over him with particular force. Whatever he started thinking about, he came back to the same questions, which he could not resolve and could not stop asking himself. It was as if the main screw in his head, which held his whole life together, had become stripped. The screw would not go in, would not come out, but turned in the same groove without catching hold, and it was impossible to stop turning it.

The postmaster came in and humbly began asking his excellency to wait only two little hours, after which (come what might) he would give his excellency post-horses. The postmaster was obviously lying and only wanted to get extra money from the traveler. �Is that bad, or is it good?� Pierre asked himself. �For me it�s good, for some other traveler it would be bad, and for the postmaster it�s inevitable, because he has nothing to eat: he says an officer gave him a thrashing on account of that. The officer gave him a thrashing because he had to leave soon. And I shot at Dolokhov because I considered myself insulted. And Louis XVI was executed because he was considered a criminal, and a year later those who executed him were also killed for something. What is bad? What is good? What should one love, what hate? Why live, and what am I? What is life, what is death? What power rules over everything?� he asked himself. And there was no answer to any of these questions except one, which was not logical and was not at all an answer to these questions. This answer was: �You will die�and everything will end. You will die and learn everything�or stop asking.� But to die was also frightening.

The Torzhok peddler woman offered him her wares in a shrill voice, especially a pair of goatskin shoes. �I have hundreds of roubles that I don�t know what to do with, and she stands there in a tattered coat and looks at me timidly,� thought Pierre. �And what does she need the money for? As if this money can add one hair�s breadth to her happiness, her peace of mind? Can anything in the world make her or me less subject to evil and death? Death, which will end everything and which must come today or tomorrow�in a moment, anyhow, compared with eternity.� And he again put pressure on the stripped screw, and the screw kept turning in one and the same place.

His servant handed him a book cut as far as the middle, an epistolary novel by Mme Souza. He started reading about the sufferings and virtuous struggle of some Am&#233;lie de Mansfield. �And why did she struggle against her seducer,� he wondered, �if she loved him? God could not have put into her soul a yearning that was contrary to His will. My former wife didn�t struggle, and maybe she was right. Nothing has been discovered,� Pierre again said to himself, �nothing has been invented. We can know only that we know nothing. And that is the highest degree of human wisdom.�

Everything within him and around him seemed confused, senseless, and loathsome. But in this very loathing for everything around him, Pierre took a sort of irritating pleasure.

�May I be so bold as to ask Your Excellency to move over a little for this gentleman?� asked the postmaster, coming into the room and bringing in another traveler who was detained for lack of horses. This was a squat, large-boned, sallow, wrinkled old man with gray, beetling brows over glittering eyes of an indefinite grayish color.

Pierre took his feet off the table, got up, and lay down on the bed prepared for him, glancing from time to time at the man who had come in and, not looking at Pierre, with a sullenly weary air, was undressing with difficulty, helped by a servant. Left in a fleece-lined nankeen coat, with felt boots on his skinny, bony legs, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned his close-cropped head, very big and broad at the temples, against the back, and looked at Bezukhov. The stern, intelligent, and penetrating expression of this look struck Pierre. He wanted to start a conversation with this traveler, but, as he was preparing to address him with a question about the road, the traveler closed his eyes and, folding his wrinkled old man�s hands, on the finger of one of which was a big cast-iron signet ring with a death�s head, sat motionless, either resting or, as it seemed to Pierre, reflecting deeply and calmly on something. The traveler�s servant was also a sallow old man, all covered with wrinkles, with no beard or mustache, which evidently had not been shaved, but had never grown. The agile old servant opened the cellaret, prepared the tea table, and brought a boiling samovar. When everything was ready, the traveler opened his eyes, moved to the table, and, having poured himself a glass, poured another for the beardless old man and handed it to him. Pierre was beginning to feel uneasiness and the necessity, even the unavoidability, of getting into conversation with this traveler.

The servant brought back his empty, overturned glass and a bitten lump of sugar, and asked whether anything was needed.

�Nothing. Give me the book,� said the traveler. The servant gave him a book, which looked like a spiritual one to Pierre, and the traveler immersed himself in reading. Pierre was looking at him. Suddenly the traveler set the book aside, having put in a bookmark and closed it, and, closing his eyes and leaning back, sat again in his former position. Pierre was looking at him and had no time to turn away before the old man opened his eyes and fixed his firm and stern gaze directly on Pierre�s face.

Pierre felt embarrassed and wanted to avoid that gaze, but the old man�s glittering eyes drew him irresistibly to them.


II

�I have the pleasure of speaking with Count Bezukhov, if I�m not mistaken,� the traveler said unhurriedly and loudly. Pierre looked silently and questioningly at his interlocutor through his spectacles.

�I�ve heard about you,� the traveler went on, �and about the misfortune that has befallen you, my dear sir.� (He underlined, as it were, the word misfortune, as if to say: �Yes, misfortune, whatever you may call it, I know that what happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.�) �I am very sorry for it, my dear sir.�

Pierre blushed and, hastily lowering his legs from the bed, leaned towards the old man, smiling unnaturally and timidly.

�I have mentioned it, my dear sir, not out of curiosity, but for more important reasons.� He paused, not letting Pierre out of his gaze, and shifted on the sofa, inviting Pierre by this gesture to sit next to him. Pierre found it unpleasant to get into conversation with this old man, but, involuntarily submitting to him, he went over and sat down next to him.

�You are unhappy, my dear sir,� he went on. �You are young, I am old. I should like to help you as much as I can.�

�Ah, yes,� said Pierre, with an unnatural smile. �I�m very grateful�Where are you coming from?� The traveler�s face was not gentle, but even cold and stern, yet in spite of that, his new acquaintance�s words and face had an irresistibly attractive effect on Pierre.

�But if for some reason you find conversation with me unpleasant,� said the old man, �say so, my dear sir.� And he suddenly smiled an unexpectedly gentle, fatherly smile.

�Ah, no, not at all, on the contrary, I�m very glad to make your acquaintance,� said Pierre, and, glancing once again at his new acquaintance�s hands, he took a closer look at his ring. He saw a death�s head on it, a Masonic sign.

�Allow me to ask,� he said, �are you a Mason?�

�Yes, I belong to the brotherhood of Freemasons,� said the traveler, peering more and more deeply into Pierre�s eyes. �And I give you a brotherly handshake on my own behalf and on theirs.�

�I�m afraid,� said Pierre, smiling and hesitating between the trust which the Mason personally inspired in him and his habit of mocking Masonic beliefs, �I�m afraid I�m very far from understanding�how shall I put it�I�m afraid my way of thinking about the universe is so much the opposite of yours that we won�t understand each other.�

�Your way of thinking is known to me,� said the Mason, �and this way of thinking of yours, which you are talking about and which seems to you the result of your own mental work, is the way of thinking of the majority of people, the monotonous fruit of pride, laziness, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I did not know it, I would not be talking with you. Your way of thinking is a lamentable error.�

�Just as I may suppose you to have fallen into error,� Pierre said with a weak smile.

�I shall never dare to say that I know the truth,� said the Mason, amazing Pierre more and more with his definite and firm speech. �No one can attain to the truth by himself; only stone by stone, with the participation of all, over millions of generations, from our forefather Adam down to our time, is the temple being built which is to become a worthy dwelling place for the great God,� said the Mason, and he closed his eyes.

�I must tell you that I don�t believe, don�t�believe in God,� Pierre said with regret and effort, feeling the need to speak the whole truth.

The Mason looked at Pierre attentively and smiled, as a rich man, holding millions in his hands, would smile at a poor man who has said to him that he, the poor man, did not have the five roubles that would make his happiness.

�But you don�t know Him, my dear sir,� said the Mason. �You cannot know Him. You don�t know Him, and that is why you are unhappy.�

�Yes, yes, I am unhappy,� Pierre agreed, �but what am I to do?�

�You don�t know Him, my dear sir, and that is why you are very unhappy. You don�t know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He is in you, and even in that blasphemous talk you have just produced,� the Mason said in a stern, trembling voice.

He paused and sighed, obviously trying to calm himself.

�If He did not exist,� he said softly, �we would not be talking about Him, my dear sir. What, whom are we talking about? Whom have you denied?� he said suddenly with rapturous sternness and power in his voice. �Who invented Him, if He does not exist? Why has the supposition appeared in you that there is such an incomprehensible being? Why do you and the whole world suppose the existence of such an unfathomable being, a being almighty, eternal, and infinite in all His qualities?�� He stopped and was silent for a long time.

Pierre could not and did not want to break that silence.

�He exists, but it is hard to understand Him,� the Mason spoke again, not looking at Pierre�s face, but straight ahead, leafing through his book with his old man�s hands, which could not remain still because of his inner turmoil. �If you doubted the existence of some man, I would bring this man to you, I would take him by the hand and show him to you. But how can I, an insignificant mortal, show all His almightiness, all His eternity, all His goodness to one who is blind, or who closes his eyes so as not to see, not to understand his own loathsomeness and depravity?� He paused. �Who are you? What are you? You fancy that you�re wise, because you were able to utter those blasphemous words,� he said with a gloomy and scornful smile, �but you are more foolish and mad than a little child who, playing with part of a skillfully made clock, would dare say that, since he does not understand the purpose of this clock, he does not believe in the master who made it. It is hard to know Him. For centuries, starting with our forefather Adam and down to our days, we have been working towards that knowledge and are infinitely far from reaching our goal; but we see our incomprehension only as our weakness and His grandeur��

With a swelling heart, with glittering eyes, Pierre gazed into the Mason�s face, listened to him, did not interrupt him, did not ask anything, and believed with his whole soul what this stranger was telling him. Whether he believed those reasonable arguments in the Mason�s speech, or believed, as children do, the intonations, convictions, and heartfelt emotion in the Mason�s speech, the trembling of his voice, which sometimes almost interrupted him, or those glittering old man�s eyes, grown old in that conviction, or the calmness, firmness, and knowledge of purpose which shone in the Mason�s whole being and which struck him especially strongly, compared with his own slackness and hopelessness, in any case he wanted to believe with his whole soul, and did believe, and experienced a joyful feeling of peace, renewal, and return to life.

�He is not apprehended by reason, but by life,� said the Mason.

�I don�t understand,� said Pierre, fearfully sensing doubt arising in him. He feared the vagueness and weakness of his interlocutor�s arguments, he feared not believing him. �I don�t understand,� he said, �how is it that human reason cannot apprehend the knowledge you speak of?�

The Mason smiled his meek, fatherly smile.

�The highest wisdom and truth is like the most pure liquid, which we want to receive into ourselves,� he said. �Can I receive this pure liquid in an impure vessel and then judge its purity? Only by purifying myself inwardly can I keep the liquid I receive pure to some degree.�

�Yes, yes, that�s so!� Pierre said joyfully.

�The supreme wisdom is based not on reason alone, not on the secular sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and so on, into which rational knowledge is divided. The higher knowledge has one science�the science of the all, the science that explains the whole universe and the place man occupies in it. To contain this science, it is necessary to purify and renew one�s inner man, and thus before one can know, one must believe and perfect oneself. And to achieve that, a divine light, called conscience, has been put in our soul.�

�Yes, yes,� Pierre agreed.

�Look at your inner man with spiritual eyes and ask if you are pleased with yourself. What have you achieved, being guided by reason alone? What are you? You are young, you are rich, you are educated, my dear sir. What have you done with all these good things that have been given you? Are you content with yourself and your life?�

�No, I hate my life,� Pierre said, wincing.

�If you hate it, change it, purify yourself, and insofar as you purify yourself, you will learn wisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir. How have you been spending it? In riotous orgies and depravity, taking everything from society and giving it nothing. You received wealth. How have you used it? What have you done for your neighbor? Have you thought about the tens of thousands of your slaves, have you helped them physically and morally? No. You have used their labor in order to lead a debauched life. That is what you have done. Have you chosen some position in which you could be useful to your neighbor? No. You have been spending your life in idleness. Then, my dear sir, you married, taking upon yourself the responsibility for guiding a young woman, and what did you do? You did not help her, my dear sir, to find the path of truth, you hurled her into an abyss of deceit and misfortune. A man insulted you, and you shot him, and you say that you do not know God and hate your life. That is no wonder, my dear sir!�

After these words, the Mason, as if tired after talking for so long, again leaned back on the sofa and closed his eyes. Pierre looked at this stern, motionless, almost dead old face and moved his lips soundlessly. He wanted to say: �Yes, a loathsome, idle, depraved life,� but he dared not break the silence.

The Mason cleared his throat hoarsely, as old people do, and called for his servant.

�What about the horses?� he asked, not looking at Pierre.

�The relay has been brought,� the servant answered. �Won�t you get some rest?�

�No, tell them to harness up.�

�Can it be he�ll go away and leave me alone, without finishing what he was saying and without promising to help me?� thought Pierre, getting up and beginning to pace the room with his head lowered, glancing occasionally at the Mason. �Yes, I didn�t think about it, but I�ve led a contemptible, depraved life, and I didn�t like it or want it,� thought Pierre, �but this man knows the truth, and if he wanted, he could reveal it to me.� Pierre wanted to say that to the Mason, but did not dare. The traveler, having packed his things, was buttoning up his coat with his old, accustomed hands. When he finished, he turned to Bezukhov and said to him indifferently, in a polite tone:

�Where are you going now, my dear sir, if I may ask?�

�Me?�To Petersburg,� Pierre replied in a childish, irresolute voice. �Thank you. I agree with you in everything. But don�t think that I�m so bad. I wish with all my soul to be what you want me to be; but I�ve never found help from anybody�However, I am to blame for it all in the first place. Help me, teach me, and maybe I�ll�� Pierre could not go on; he snuffed his nose and turned away.

The Mason was silent for a long time, evidently thinking something over.

�Help is given only by God,� he said, �but that measure of help which our order has in its power to give you, it will give you, my dear sir. You are going to Petersburg. Give this to Count Willarski� (he took out his pocketbook and wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four). �Allow me to give you one piece of advice. When you arrive in the capital, devote the initial time to solitude, to examining yourself, and do not set out on the former ways of life. With that I wish you a good journey, my dear sir,� he said, noticing that his servant had come into the room, �and success��

The traveler was Osip Alexeevich Bazdeev, as Pierre learned from the postmaster�s register. Bazdeev had been one of the best-known Masons and Martinists even back in Novikov�s time. Long after his departure, Pierre, neither going to bed nor asking for horses, paced the station-house room, thinking over his depraved past and, with a rapture of renewal, picturing to himself his blissful, irreproachable, and virtuous future, which seemed so easy to him. He had been depraved, it seemed to him, only because he had somehow accidentally forgotten how good it was to be virtuous. In his soul there remained no trace of his former doubts. He firmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of people, united with the purpose of supporting each other on the path of virtue, and that was what he imagined Masonry to be.


III

On arriving in Petersburg, Pierre did not inform anyone of his arrival, did not go out anywhere, and started spending whole days reading Thomas &#224; Kempis, a book which some unknown person had delivered to him. Pierre understood one thing and one thing only while reading this book; he understood the delight, previously unknown to him, of the possibility of achieving perfection and the possibility of brotherly and active love among people, which Osip Alexeevich had revealed to him. A week after his arrival, the young Polish count Willarski, whom Pierre knew superficially in Petersburg society, came into his room in the evening with that official and solemn look with which Dolokhov�s second had come to him, and, closing the door behind him and making sure that there was no one in the room except Pierre, addressed him.

�I have come to you with a suggestion and a message, Count,� he said, without sitting down. �A person very highly placed in our brotherhood has solicited for you to be received into the brotherhood before the fixed term, and has suggested that I be your sponsor. I consider it my sacred duty to fulfill the will of this person. Do you wish, under my sponsorship, to enter the brotherhood of Freemasons?�

The cold and severe tone of this man whom he had almost always seen at balls with an amiable smile, in the society of the most brilliant women, struck Pierre.

�Yes, I do,� he said.

Willarski inclined his head.

�One more question, Count,� he said, �which I ask you to answer not as a future Mason, but as an honest man (galant homme), in all sincerity: have you renounced your former convictions, do you believe in God?�

Pierre reflected.

�Yes�yes, I believe in God,� he said.

�In that case�� Willarski began, but Pierre interrupted him.

�Yes, I believe in God,� he said once more.

�In that case we can go,� said Willarski. �My carriage is at your service.�

Willarski was silent the whole way. To Pierre�s question of what he must do and how to answer, Willarski said only that brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre need do nothing more than tell the truth.

Having driven through the gates of a big house where the lodge was quartered and gone up a dark stairway, they went into a small, well-lit anteroom, where they took off their fur coats without the help of servants. From the anteroom they went into another room. Some man in strange attire appeared at the door. Willarski, going to meet him, said something to him quietly in French and went over to a small wardrobe, in which Pierre noticed kinds of attire he had never seen before. Taking a cloth from the wardrobe, Willarski put it over Pierre�s eyes and knotted it behind, catching Pierre�s hair painfully. Then he drew him to himself, kissed him, and, taking his hand, led him somewhere. The hair caught in the knot caused him pain, he winced and smiled from pain and shame at something. His enormous figure, with lowered arms and wincing, smiling physiognomy, moved after Willarski with uncertain, timid steps.

Having led him by the hand for some ten paces, Willarski stopped.

�Whatever happens to you,� he said, �you must courageously endure everything, if you are firmly resolved to enter our brotherhood.� (Pierre responded affirmatively by inclining his head.) �When you hear knocking on the door, you will unbind your eyes,� added Willarski. �I wish you courage and success.� And, pressing Pierre�s hand, Willarski went out.

Left alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. He shrugged his shoulders a couple of times, put his hand to the cloth as if wishing to take it off, and lowered it again. The five minutes he spent blindfolded seemed like an hour to him. His hands became swollen, his legs gave way under him; it seemed to him that he was tired. He experienced the most complex and varied feelings. He was afraid of what was going to happen to him, and still more afraid that he would show his fear. He was curious to know what he was about to go through, what would be revealed to him; but most of all he felt joy that the moment had come when he would finally enter the path of renewal and an actively virtuous life which he had been dreaming of since his meeting with Osip Alexeevich. There was loud knocking at the door. Pierre took off the blindfold and looked around. The room was pitch-dark: only in one place a lamp was burning inside something white. Pierre went closer and saw that the lamp was standing on a black table on which lay an open book. The book was the Gospel; the white thing in which the lamp was burning was a human skull with its holes and teeth. Having read the first words of the Gospel: �In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,� Pierre went around the table and saw a large open box filled with something. This was a coffin with bones. He was not surprised in the least by what he saw. Hoping to enter a totally new life, totally different from his former one, he expected everything to be extraordinary, still more extraordinry than what he saw. A skull, a coffin, the Gospel�it seemed he had expected it all, had expected still more. Trying to call up a tender feeling in himself, he looked around. �God, death, love, the brotherhood of men,� he said to himself, connecting vague but joyful notions of something with these words. The door opened and someone came in.

By the faint light, to which Pierre�s eyes, however, had become accustomed, a short man came in. Evidently having come from light into darkness, the man stopped; then he moved with cautious steps towards the table and placed on it his small hands covered with leather gloves.

This short man was wearing a white leather apron that covered his chest and part of his legs, on his neck there was some sort of necklace, and behind the necklace rose a high white jabot, framing his elongated face, which was lit from below.

�Why have you come here?� asked the man, turning in the direction of Pierre, who had made a slight rustle. �Why have you, who do not believe in the truths of the light and do not see the light, why have you come here, what do you want from us? Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?�

At the moment when the door opened and the unknown man came in, Pierre experienced a feeling of fear and awe similar to what he had experienced in childhood at confession; he felt himself alone with a man who was a total stranger in the circumstances of life, yet close in the brotherhood of men. With a pounding heart that took his breath away, Pierre moved towards the rhetor (so the masons call a brother who prepares a seeker to enter the brotherhood). Coming closer, Pierre recognized the rhetor as an acquaintance, Smolyaninov, but it offended him to think that he was an acquaintance: the man who had come in was only a brother and a virtuous preceptor. For a long time, Pierre could not utter a word, so that the rhetor had to repeat his question:

�Yes, I�I�want renewal,� Pierre uttered with difficulty.

�Very well,� said Smolyaninov, and he went on at once: �Do you have any idea of the means by which our holy order can help you to achieve your goal?�� the rhetor asked calmly and quickly.

�I�hope�for guidance�help�in my renewal,� Pierre said in a trembling voice and speaking with difficulty, owing to his excitement and to being unused to speaking about abstract subjects in Russian.

�What is your notion of Freemasonry?�

�I presume that Freemasonry is the fraternit&#233; and equality of men with virtuous goals,� said Pierre, embarrassed, even as he was speaking, by the unsuitability of his words to the solemnity of the moment. �I presume��

�Very well,� the rhetor said hastily, evidently fully satisfied with this reply. �Have you sought the means of achieving your goal in religion?�

�No, I considered it incorrect and did not follow it,� Pierre said, so softly that the rhetor did not hear and asked him what he had said. �I was an atheist,� Pierre replied.

�You seek the truth in order to follow its laws in life; consequently, you seek wisdom and virtue, is that it?� the rhetor said after a moment�s silence.

�Yes, yes,� Pierre agreed.

The rhetor cleared his throat, folded his gloved hands on his chest, and began to speak.

�Now I must reveal to you the main goal of our order,� he said, �and if this goal coincides with yours, it will be useful for you to enter our brotherhood. The first main goal and withal the foundation of our order, on which it is established and which no human power can cast down, is the preservation and handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery�which has come down to us from ancient times and even from the first man, on which mystery, perhaps, the fate of the human race depends. But as it is the nature of this mystery that no one can know it and use it unless he has been prepared by long and diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope soon to attain it. Therefore we have a second goal, which consists in preparing our members as much as possible, setting their hearts to rights, purifying and enlightening their reason by means revealed to us by tradition from men who labored in search of this mystery, and thereby making them capable of apprehending it.

�In purifying and setting to rights our members, we try, thirdly, to set to rights the whole human race, offering it, through our members, an example of piety and virtue, and thereby trying with all our might to oppose the evil that reigns in the world. Think it over, and I will come to you again,� he said and left the room.

�To oppose the evil that reigns in the world�� Pierre repeated, and he pictured his future activity on this path. He pictured people such as he himself had been two weeks ago, and he mentally addressed to them a didactic and admonitory speech. He pictured depraved and unfortunate people whom he helped in word and deed; he pictured oppressors whose victims he saved. Of the three goals mentioned by the rhetor, this last one�setting mankind to rights�was especially close to Pierre. The certain important mystery which the rhetor had mentioned, though it aroused his curiosity, did not seem essential to him; and the second goal, purifying and setting himself to rights, interested him little, because at that moment he enjoyed feeling himself already fully set to rights from his former vices and ready only for the good.

Half an hour later the rhetor came back to transmit to the seeker the seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon�s temple, which every Mason was supposed to cultivate in himself. These virtues were: (1) discretion, keeping the secrets of the order; (2) obedience to the higher ranks of the order; (3) good morals; (4) love of mankind; (5) courage; (6) generosity; and (7) love of death.

�Seventh,� said the rhetor, �try by frequent thoughts of death to bring yourself to the point where it no longer seems a fearsome enemy to you, but a friend�who delivers the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this calamitous life and leads it to the place of recompense and peace.�

�Yes, that should be so,� thought Pierre, when, after these words, the rhetor went away again, leaving him to his solitary reflections. �That should be so, but I�m still so weak that I love my life, the meaning of which is only now being gradually revealed to me.� But he did feel in his soul the other five virtues that he remembered, counting them on his fingers: courage, and generosity, and good morals, and love of mankind, and especially obedience, which even seemed to him not a virtue, but happiness itself. (It was so joyful for him now to be delivered of his arbitrariness and submit his will to a person or persons who knew the unquestionable truth.) Pierre forgot the seventh virtue and simply could not recall what it was.

The third time the rhetor came back sooner and asked Pierre whether he was still firm in his intention and was determined to submit himself to everything that was demanded of him.

�I�m ready for everything,� said Pierre.

�I must also inform you,� said the rhetor, �that our order conveys its teaching not only by words, but by other means which affect the true seeker of wisdom and virtue perhaps even more strongly than verbal explanations. This temple, with its decorations, which you see, must already have explained to your heart, if it is sincere, more than words can do; you will see, perhaps, during your further initiation, a similar means of explanation. Our order imitates ancient societies, which revealed their teaching through hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph,� said the rhetor, �is the designation of something not subject to the senses, which contains in itself qualities similar to what it is imaging.�

Pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but did not dare speak. He listened silently to the rhetor, feeling from it all that the testing was about to begin.

�If you are firm, then I must commence your induction,� said the rhetor, coming closer to Pierre. �As a sign of generosity, I ask you to give me all your valuables.�

�But I have nothing with me,� said Pierre, thinking that he was being asked to hand over everything he owned.

�That is, what you have with you: a watch, money, rings��

Pierre hurriedly took out his purse, his watch, but for a long time could not get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that was done, the Mason said:

�As a sign of obedience, I ask you to undress.� Pierre took off his tailcoat, his waistcoat, and his left boot, as the rhetor directed. The Mason opened his shirt on his left breast and, bending down, pulled up his left trouser leg above the knee. Pierre wanted hurriedly to take off his right boot and pull up his trouser, to spare the stranger the effort, but the Mason said there was no need for that and handed him a slipper for his left foot. With a childish smile of embarrassment, doubt, and self-mockery, which came to his face against his will, Pierre stood with lowered arms and straddled legs before his brother rhetor, waiting for new orders from him.

�And, finally, as a sign of openheartedness, I ask you to reveal to me your main predilection,� he said.

�My predilection! I had so many,� said Pierre.

�The predilection which, more than all others, made you vacillate on the path of virtue,� said the Mason.

Pierre paused, searching.

�Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Hot temper? Anger? Women?� he went through his vices, weighing them mentally, and did not know which to give preference to.

�Women,� Pierre said in a low, barely audible voice. The Mason did not stir and did not speak for a long time after this reply. At last he moved towards Pierre, took the cloth that was lying on the table, and again blindfolded him.

�I tell you for the last time: turn all your attention to yourself, lay chains upon your feelings, and seek blessedness not in passions, but in your own heart�The source of blessedness is not outside, but inside us��

Pierre already felt in himself that refreshing source of blessedness which now filled his soul with joy and tender feeling.


IV

Soon after that, it was not the rhetor who came into the dark temple for Pierre, but his sponsor Willarski, whom he recognized by his voice. To renewed questions about the firmness of his intentions, Pierre replied:

�Yes, yes, I agree,� and with a radiant, childish smile, with his fat chest bared, walking unevenly and timidly with one shod foot and the other unshod, he went ahead, with Willarski holding a sword to his bared chest. From the room he was led down corridors, turning back and forth, and was finally led to the doors of the lodge. Willarski coughed, the response was a Masonic rapping of hammers, and the door opened before him. Someone�s bass voice (Pierre was still blindfolded) asked him questions about who he was, where and when he was born, and so on. Then he was again led somewhere with his eyes still covered, and as he walked, they told him allegories about the labors of his journey, about sacred friendship, about the pre-eternal architect of the world, about the courage with which he must endure toils and dangers. During the journey, Pierre noticed that they referred to him now as the seeker, now as the sufferer, now as the postulant, and made various noises with hammers and swords. Just as he was brought to some sort of object, he noticed that there was perplexity and confusion among his guides. He heard the men around him arguing among themselves in whispers, and one of them insisting that he had to be led across some sort of rug. After that, they took his right hand, put it on something, and told him to hold a compass to his left breast with his left hand, and made him recite the oath of fidelity to the laws of the order, repeating words that someone else read. Then they put out the candles, lit a spirit lamp, as Pierre knew by the smell, and told him he would see the lesser light. The blindfold was removed from his eyes, and Pierre saw as in a dream, by the faint light of the spirit lamp, several men who stood facing him in the same aprons as the rhetor and holding swords pointed at his breast. Among them stood a man in a bloody white shirt. Seeing that, Pierre moved his chest towards the swords, wishing them to pierce him. But the swords withdrew, and his eyes were covered again.

�Now you have seen the lesser light,� someone�s voice said to him. Then candles were lit again, the voices said he must see the full light, and his eyes were uncovered again, and more than ten voices suddenly said: �Sic transit gloria mundi.�

Pierre gradually began to come to himself and look around at the room he was in and the men who were in it. Some twelve men were sitting around a long table covered in black, all in the same attire as he had already seen. Pierre knew some of them from Petersburg society. In the chairman�s place sat an unknown young man with a special cross on his neck. To his right sat the Italian abb&#233; Pierre had seen two years before at Anna Pavlovna�s. There was a rather important dignitary, and a Swiss tutor who formerly lived with the Kuragins. They were all solemnly silent, listening to the words of the chairman, who was holding a hammer in his hand. The wall had a burning star embedded in it; on one side of the table was a small rug with various images, on the other something like an altar with a Gospel book and a skull. Around the table stood seven large candle stands, as in a church. Two of the brothers led Pierre to the altar, placed his feet at right angles, and ordered him to lie down, saying that he now prostrates himself at the gates of the temple.

�He should receive the trowel first,� one of the brothers said in a whisper.

�Ah, enough, I beg you!� said another.

Pierre looked around perplexedly with his nearsighted eyes, not obeying, and doubt suddenly came over him: �Where am I? What am I doing? Aren�t they laughing at me? Won�t I be ashamed to remember it?� But this doubt lasted only a moment. Pierre looked at the serious faces of the people around him, remembered all he had already gone through, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was horrified at his doubt, and, trying to recall his former tender feeling, he prostrated at the gates of the temple. And indeed a tender feeling still stronger than before came over him. After he had lain there for some time, they told him to get up and put on a white leather apron such as the others were wearing, handed him a trowel and three pairs of gloves, and then the grand master addressed him. He told him to try not to stain in any way the whiteness of this apron, which represented strength and blamelessness; then, of the unexplained trowel, he told him to work with it to purify his heart of vice and tolerantly smooth over the heart of his neighbor. Then, of the first pair of men�s gloves, he said that Pierre could not know their meaning, but had to keep them; of the second pair of men�s gloves, he said that he was to wear them at meetings; and, finally, of the third pair, which were women�s gloves, he said:

�My gentle brother, these women�s gloves are destined for you as well. Give them to the woman whom you honor most of all. By this gift you will give assurance of the blamelessness of your heart to the one whom you elect as your worthy lady Mason.� After a pause, he added: �But preserve these gloves, gentle brother, that they not adorn unclean hands.� Just as the grand master pronounced these last words, it seemed to Pierre that the chairman became embarrassed. Pierre became still more embarrassed, blushed to the point of tears, as children do, started looking around uneasily, and an awkward silence ensued.

This silence was broken by one of the brothers, who, leading Pierre to the rug, began reading to him from a notebook the explanation of all the images depicted on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a trowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows, and so on. Then Pierre was assigned his place, shown the signs of the lodge, told the password, and finally allowed to sit down. The grand master began to read the rules. The rules were very long, and Pierre, from joy, excitement, and abashedness, was unable to understand what was being read to him. He heard well only the last words of the rules, which stayed in his memory:

�In our temples we know no other distinctions,� the grand master read, �than those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any distinction that may violate equality. Fly to aid your brother, whoever he may be, instruct him who errs, raise up the fallen, and never nurse any malice or enmity against your brother. Be gentle and affable. Arouse the fire of virtue in all hearts. Share your happiness with your neighbor, and let envy never cloud this pure delight.

�Forgive your enemy, take no revenge upon him, unless it be by doing him good. Having thus fulfilled the higher law, you will recover the traces of the ancient majesty you have lost,� he concluded and, standing up, he embraced Pierre and kissed him.

Pierre looked around with tears of joy in his eyes, not knowing how to reply to the congratulations and renewals of acquaintance that surrounded him. He did not recognize any acquaintances; in all these people he saw only brothers, and he burned with impatience to start working with them.

The grand master rapped with his hammer, everyone sat down in their places, and one brother read a sermon about the necessity of humility.

The grand master suggested that they fulfill the last duty, and the important dignitary, who bore the title of alms collector, started making the round of the brothers. Pierre wanted to write down all the money he had on the list of alms, but was afraid of showing pride and wrote down the same amount as the others did.

The meeting was over, and on his return home it seemed to Pierre that he had come back from some distant journey, where he had spent dozens of years, had changed completely, and had detached himself from the former order and habits of his life.


V

The day after his reception into the lodge, Pierre was sitting at home, reading a book and trying to make out the meaning of a square, one side of which represented God, another the moral, the third the physical, and the fourth their mixture. From time to time he tore himself away from the book and the square, and in his imagination put together a new plan of life for himself. The day before, he had been told in the lodge that the rumor of his duel had reached the sovereign, and that it would be sensible for Pierre to leave Petersburg. Pierre planned to go to his southern estates and occupy himself with his peasants. He was joyfully contemplating this new life when Prince Vassily unexpectedly came into the room.

�My friend, what have you done in Moscow? Why did you quarrel with Lelya, mon cher? You are mistaken,� said Prince Vassily as he came in. �I�ve found out everything and can tell you for certain that H&#233;l&#232;ne is as innocent before you as Christ before the Jews.�

Pierre was about to reply, but he interrupted him.

�And why didn�t you turn to me directly and simply as a friend? I know it all, I understand it all,� he said. �You behaved as befits a man who cherishes his honor; perhaps too hastily, but we won�t discuss that. Only understand in what position you have placed her and myself in the eyes of the whole of society and even of the court,� he added, lowering his voice. �She�s living in Moscow, you here. Come, my dear,� he pulled his hand downwards, �this is nothing but a misunderstanding; I think you feel that yourself. Let�s write her a letter right now, and she�ll come here, everything will be explained, and all this talk will end, or else, I tell you, you may very well suffer for it, my dear.�

Prince Vassily looked imposingly at Pierre.

�I have it from good sources that the dowager empress is taking a lively interest in this whole affair. You know, she�s very favorable to H&#233;l&#232;ne.�

Pierre was on the point of speaking several times, but, on the one hand, Prince Vassily would not let him, hastily cutting off all conversation, and on the other hand, Pierre himself was afraid he might not begin speaking in the tone of resolute refusal and disagreement in which he was firmly resolved to answer his father-in-law. Besides, the words of the Masonic rule��Be gentle and affable��came to his mind. He winced, blushed, rose up, sank back, working on himself in what was for him the most difficult thing in life�to say something unpleasant to a person�s face, to say something that the person, whoever he might be, was not expecting. He was so used to obeying Prince Vassily�s tone of casual self-assurance that this time, too, he felt he would be unable to oppose it; yet he felt that his whole future destiny would depend on what he said right now: whether he would follow the old former way, or the new one which had been shown to him so attractively by the Masons, and on which he firmly believed he would find rebirth into a new life.

�Well, my dear,� Prince Vassily said jokingly, �say �yes� to me, and I�ll write to her myself, and we can kill the fatted calf.� But Prince Vassily had no time to finish his joke, because Pierre, with a fury in his face that was reminiscent of his father, without looking his interlocutor in the eye, said in a quiet whisper:

�Prince, I did not invite you here�go, please, go!� He jumped up and opened the door for him. �Go now,� he repeated, not believing himself and glad of the expression of embarrassment and fear that appeared on Prince Vassily�s face.

�What�s the matter with you? Are you ill?�

�Go!� the menacing voice said once more. And Prince Vassily was forced to leave without receiving any explanation.

A week later, having said good-bye to his new Mason friends and having left them large sums for alms, Pierre went off to his estates. His new brothers gave him letters to the Masons of Kiev and Odessa and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity.


VI

The affair between Pierre and Dolokhov was hushed up, and, despite the sovereign�s severity concerning duels, neither the two adversaries nor their seconds suffered. But the story of the duel, confirmed by Pierre�s separation from his wife, spread in society. Pierre, who had been viewed indulgently, patronizingly, when he was an illegitimate son, who had been coddled and made much of when he was the best suitor in the Russian empire, had lost much in the opinion of society after his marriage, when brides and mothers had nothing to expect from him, the more so as he neither could nor would seek its favor. Now he alone was blamed for what had happened; it was said that he was a jealous dunderhead, subject to the same fits of bloodthirsty rage as his father. And when H&#233;l&#232;ne returned to Petersburg after Pierre�s departure, she was received by all her acquaintances not only cordially, but with a shade of deference, in view of her misfortunes. When talk turned to her husband, H&#233;l&#232;ne assumed a dignified expression, which she�though without understanding its significance�adopted with her own special tact. This expression meant that she was resolved to endure her misfortune without complaining, and that her husband was a cross sent her by God. Prince Vassily voiced his opinion with more candor. He would shrug his shoulders when the talk turned to Pierre and say, tapping his forehead:

�Un cerveau f&#234;l&#233;�je le disais toujours.�

�I said it first thing,� Anna Pavlovna would say of Pierre, �I said at once then and before everyone else� (she insisted on her priority), �that he is a crazy young man, spoiled by the depraved ideas of our time. I said it back when everyone admired him, and he had just come from abroad and, remember, played some sort of Marat at one of my soir&#233;es. And how did it end? Even then I didn�t want this marriage, and predicted everything that�s happened.�

As before, Anna Pavlovna, on free evenings, held soir&#233;es at her home such as she alone had the gift to organize�evenings at which, first of all, there gathered la cr&#232;me de la v&#233;ritable bonne soci&#233;t&#233;, la fine fleur de l�essence intellectuelle de la soci&#233;t&#233; de P&#233;tersbourg, as Anna Pavlovna herself put it. Besides this refined selection of society, Anna Pavlovna�s soir&#233;es were also distinguished in that, at each soir&#233;e, Anna Pavlovna served up for her guests some new, interesting person, and that nowhere as at these soir&#233;es did the level of the political thermometer indicate the mood of legitimist Petersburg court society so clearly and firmly.

At the end of 1806, when all the sad details had been received of Napoleon�s destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerst&#228;dt and the surrender of most of the Prussian fortresses, when our army had already entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon had begun, Anna Pavlovna gathered a soir&#233;e in her home. La cr&#232;me de la v&#233;ritable bonne soci&#233;t&#233; consisted of the enchanting and unfortunate H&#233;l&#232;ne, abandoned by her husband, of Mortemart, of the enchanting Prince Ippolit, just come from Vienna, two diplomats, the aunt, a young man who in this drawing room simply bore the title of un homme de beaucoup de m&#233;rite, a newly appointed lady-in-waiting with her mother, and some other less conspicuous persons.

The person to whom Anna Pavlovna treated her guests as a novelty that evening was Boris Drubetskoy, who had just come as a courier from the Prussian army, where he was an adjutant attached to a very important person.

The level of the political thermometer shown to the company that evening was the following: however hard all European sovereigns and military leaders try to pander to Bonapartius, in order to cause me, and us in general, unpleasantness and grief, our opinion of Bonapartius cannot change. We will not cease to voice our unfeigned way of thinking on that account, and we can only say to the Prussian king and others: �So much the worse for you. Tu l�as voulu, Georges Dandin, that�s all we can say.� That was what the political thermometer indicated at Anna Pavlovna�s soir&#233;e. When Boris, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the drawing room, nearly the entire company had gathered, and the conversation, guided by Anna Pavlovna, had to do with our diplomatic relations with Austria and the hope of alliance with her.

Boris, in a dashing adjutant�s uniform, matured, fresh, and red-cheeked, walked freely into the drawing room and was duly taken to greet the aunt, and then reattached to the general circle.

Anna Pavlovna gave him her dry hand to kiss, introduced him to some strangers, and whispered her definitions of them to him.

�Le prince Hyppolite Kouragine�charmant jeune homme. Monsieur Kroug, charg&#233; d�affaires de Kopenhague�un esprit profond,� and simply: �Monsieur Shittoff, un homme de beaucoup de m&#233;rite,� of the one who bore that title.

Boris, during the time of his service, thanks to the efforts of Anna Mikhailovna, his own tastes, and the qualities of his reserved character, had managed to put himself in a most advantageous position in the service. He was an adjutant to a very important person, had a very important mission in Prussia, and had just returned from there as a courier. He had fully adopted the unwritten subordination he had liked so much in Olm&#252;tz, according to which an ensign could have incomparably higher standing than a general, and according to which, for success in the service, one needed not efforts, not labors, not courage, not perseverance, but only skill in dealing with those who give rewards for service�and he was often surprised at his quick success and at how others could fail to understand it. Thanks to this discovery, his whole way of life, all his relations with former acquaintances, and all his plans for the future had changed completely. He was not rich, but he spent his last penny to dress better than others; he would sooner deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to drive in a shabby carriage or appear in an old uniform in the streets of Petersburg. He made friends and sought acquaintances only with people who were above him and therefore could be of use to him. He loved Petersburg and despised Moscow. The memory of the Rostovs� house and his childhood love for Natasha was disagreeable to him, and he had never once visited the Rostovs since joining the army. He considered his presence in Anna Pavlovna�s drawing room as an important promotion in the service, and he now understood at once his role there and left it to Anna Pavlovna to exploit the interest contained in him, while studying every person attentively and evaluating the advantages and possibilities of making friends with each of them. He sat down in the place shown him by the beautiful H&#233;l&#232;ne and listened to the general conversation.

��Vienne trouve les bases du trait&#233; propos&#233; tellement hors d�atteinte, qu�on ne saurait y parvenir m&#234;me par une continuit&#233; de succ&#232;s les plus brillants, et elle met en doute les moyens qui pourraient nous les procurer.� C�est la phrase authentique du cabinet de Vienne,� the Danish charg&#233; d�affaires was saying.

�C�est le doute qui est flatteur,� said l�homme &#224; l�esprit profond with a subtle smile.

�Il faut distinguer entre le cabinet de Vienne et l�Empereur d�Autriche,� said Mortemart. �L�Empereur d�Autriche n�a jamais pu penser &#224; une chose pareille, ce n�est que le cabinet qui le dit.�

�Eh, mon cher vicomte,� Anna Pavlovna mixed in, �l�Urope� (for some reason she pronounced it l�Urope, as if it was some special subtlety of the French language, which she could allow herself when speaking with a Frenchman), �l�Urope ne sera jamais notre alli&#233;e sinc&#232;re.�

After which Anna Pavlovna led the conversation towards the courage and firmness of the Prussian king, in order to bring Boris into things.

Boris listened attentively to what was being said, waiting for his turn, but at the same time he managed to glance several times at his neighbor, the beautiful H&#233;l&#232;ne, who several times met the eyes of the handsome young adjutant with a smile.

Quite naturally, in speaking of the position of Prussia, Anna Pavlovna asked Boris to tell them about his trip to Glogau and the situation in which he found the Prussian army. Boris, unhurriedly, in pure and correct French, told quite a few interesting details about the army and the court, taking care all through his account to avoid stating his own opinion concerning the facts he conveyed. For some time Boris commanded general attention, and Anna Pavlovna felt that the novelty she had treated them to was received with pleasure by all the guests. H&#233;l&#232;ne paid the most attention of all to Boris�s story. She asked him several times about certain details of his trip and seemed to be very interested in the position of the Prussian army. As soon as he finished, she turned to him with her usual smile.

�Il faut absolument que vous veniez me voir,� she said to him in a tone implying that, for certain considerations, which he could not know, this was an absolute necessity. �Mardi entre les huit et neuf heures. Vous me ferez grand plaisir.�

Boris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to get into conversation with her, when Anna Pavlovna called him away, on the pretext that her aunt wanted to hear him.

�You do know her husband?� said Anna Pavlovna, closing her eyes and pointing to H&#233;l&#232;ne with a sad gesture. �Ah, she�s such an unhappy and lovely woman! Don�t speak of him in her presence, please don�t speak of him. It�s too painful for her!�


VII

When Boris and Anna Pavlovna returned to the general circle, the conversation there had been taken over by Prince Ippolit. Leaning forward in his armchair, he said:

�Le Roi de Prusse!� and, having said it, he began to laugh. Everyone turned to him. �Le Roi de Prusse?� Ippolit asked, laughed again, and again calmly and seriously sat back in the depths of his armchair. Anna Pavlovna waited a little, but as it seemed that Ippolit decidedly had no intention of saying more, she began to tell about how the godless Bonaparte purloined the sword of Frederick the Great in Potsdam.

�C�est l�&#233;p&#233;e de Fr&#233;d&#233;ric le Grand que je�� she began, but Ippolit interrupted her with the words:

�Le Roi de Prusse�� and again, as soon as they turned to him, he apologized and fell silent. Anna Pavlovna winced. Mortemart, Ippolit�s friend, addressed him resolutely:

�Voyons &#224; qui en avez vous avec votre Roi de Prusse?�

Ippolit laughed, as if he was ashamed of his own laughter.

�Non, ce n�est rien, je voulais dire seulement�� (He intended to repeat a joke that he had heard in Vienna and that he had been trying to put in all evening.) �Je voulais dire seulement que nous avons tort de faire la guerre �pour le Roi de Prusse.��

Boris smiled cautiously, so that his smile could be understood either as mockery or as approval of the joke, depending on how it was received. Everyone laughed.

�Il est tr&#232;s mauvais, votre jeu de mots, tr&#232;s spirituel, mais injuste,� said Anna Pavlovna, shaking her shriveled finger. �Nous ne faisons pas la guerre pour le Roi de Prusse, mais pour les bons principes. Ah, le m&#233;chant, ce prince Hyppolite!� she said.

The conversation did not flag all evening, turning mostly around political news. At the end of the evening it became especially lively when things got around to the rewards bestowed by the sovereign.

�Last year N. N. received a snuffbox with a portrait,� said l�homme &#224; l�&#233;sprit profond, �why shouldn�t S. S. receive the same reward?�

�Je vous demande pardon, une tabati&#232;re avec le portrait de l�Empereur est une r&#233;compense, mais point une distinction,� said the diplomat, �un cadeau plut&#244;t.�

�Il y eu plut&#244;t de ant&#233;c&#233;dents, je vous citerai Schwarzenberg.�

�C�est impossible,� another objected to him.

�Let�s bet on it. Le grand cordon, c�est diff&#233;rent��

When they all got up to leave, H&#233;l&#232;ne, who had spoken little all evening, again turned to Boris with the request and the gentle, meaningful order that he visit her on Tuesday.

�It�s very necessary for me,� she said with a smile, glancing at Anna Pavlovna, and Anna Pavlovna, with the same sad smile that accompanied her words when her exalted patroness was mentioned, seconded H&#233;l&#232;ne�s wish. It seemed as though, from certain words that Boris had spoken that evening about the Prussian troops, H&#233;l&#232;ne had suddenly discovered the necessity of seeing him. It was as if she were promising him that, when he came on Tuesday, she would explain that necessity to him.

Having come on Tuesday evening to H&#233;l&#232;ne�s magnificent salon, Boris was not given a clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come. There were other guests, the countess spoke little to him, and only as he kissed her hand on taking his leave did she, with a strange absence of a smile, unexpectedly, in a whisper, say to him:

�Venez demain d&#238;ner�le soir. Il faut que vous veniez�Venez.�

During this stay in Petersburg, Boris became an intimate of Countess Bezukhov�s house.


VIII

The war was heating up, and its theater was approaching the borders of Russia. Everywhere curses were heard on the enemy of the human race Bonapartius; militia and recruits were being gathered from the villages, and divergent news kept coming from the theater of the war, false as usual and therefore reinterpreted in various ways.

The life of old Prince Bolkonsky, Prince Andrei, and Princess Marya had changed much since 1805.

In 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief of the militia then appointed all over Russia. The old prince, despite the weakness of age, which had become especially noticeable during the time when he counted his son as killed, did not believe he had the right to refuse the function assigned to him by the sovereign himself, and this activity newly opened up for him roused and strengthened him. He traveled continually around the three provinces entrusted to him; he was thorough to the point of pedantry in his duties, strict to the point of cruelty with his subordinates, and personally entered into the minutest details of things. Princess Marya now stopped taking lessons in mathematics from her father, and merely went to her father�s study in the mornings, whenever he was at home, accompanied by the wet nurse and little Prince Nikolai (as his grandfather called him). The nursing Prince Nikolai lived with his wet nurse and the nanny Savishna in the rooms of the late princess, and Princess Marya spent the greater part of the day in the nursery, replacing her little nephew�s mother as well as she could. Mlle Bourienne also seemed to love the boy passionately, and Princess Marya, often depriving herself, yielded to her friend the pleasure of dandling the �little angel� (as she called her nephew) and playing with him.

Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the grave of the little princess, and in the chapel had been placed a marble memorial, brought from Italy, in the form of an angel with spread wings ready to soar into the sky. The angel had a slightly raised upper lip, as if he was about to smile, and once, as they were leaving the chapel, Prince Andrei and Princess Marya confessed to each other that the angel�s face strangely reminded them of the face of the deceased woman. But stranger still was something that Prince Andrei did not tell his sister, which was that in the expression which the artist had chanced to give the angel�s face, Prince Andrei read the same words of meek reproach he had once read on his dead wife�s face: �Ah, why have you done this to me?��

Soon after Prince Andrei�s return, the old prince separated his son�s share of the inheritance and gave him Bogucharovo, a large estate thirty miles from Bald Hills. Partly on account of the painful memories connected with Bald Hills, partly because Prince Andrei did not always feel able to bear calmly with his father�s character, and partly because he needed solitude, Prince Andrei took advantage of Bogucharovo, began building, and spent most of his time there.

After the Austerlitz campaign, Prince Andrei had firmly decided never to serve in the army again; and when war began and everyone had to serve, he took a post raising militia under his father�s leadership, in order to get out of active service. It was as if, after the campaign of 1805, the old prince and his son had exchanged roles. The old prince, roused by his activity, expected nothing but good from the present campaign; Prince Andrei, on the contrary, not taking part in the war, and regretting it deep in his heart, saw nothing but bad.

On the twenty-sixth of February, 1807, the old prince left on his rounds. Prince Andrei stayed at Bald Hills, as he did most often during his father�s absence. Little Nikolushka had been ill for three days now. The coachman who drove the old prince came back from town bringing papers and letters for Prince Andrei.

The valet with the letters did not find the young prince in his study and went to Princess Marya�s side; but he was not there either. The valet was told that the prince had gone to the nursery.

�If you please, Your Excellency, Petrusha has come with papers,� said one of the maids who assisted the nanny, addressing Prince Andrei, who was sitting on a child�s little chair, frowning, his hands trembling, pouring drops of medicine from a vial into a glass half filled with water.

�What�s that?� he said crossly, and his hand carelessly twitched, pouring an extra number of drops from the vial into the glass. He dumped the medicine on the floor and asked for more water. The maid gave it to him.

In the room stood a baby�s crib, two trunks, two armchairs, a table, and a child�s table with the little chair on which Prince Andrei was sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a candle burned on the table, screened by a bound music book to shield the bed from the light.

�My friend,� said Princess Marya, addressing her brother from beside the crib where she was standing, �it�s better to wait�later��

�Ah, for pity�s sake, you keep saying stupid things, and you keep wanting to wait�see, we�ve waited,� said Prince Andrei in a spiteful whisper, clearly with the wish to sting his sister.

�My friend, really, it�s better not to wake him, he�s asleep,� the princess said in a pleading voice.

Prince Andrei got up and, holding the glass, tiptoed towards the crib.

�So you really think we shouldn�t wake him?� he said hesitantly.

�As you wish�really�I think�but as you wish,� said Princess Marya, clearly abashed and ashamed that her opinion had triumphed. She pointed to the maid, who was calling to her brother in a whisper.

It was the second night that the two of them had not slept, looking after the boy, who was burning with fever. For two whole days, not trusting their house doctor and expecting the one they had sent for from town, they had been trying now one, now another remedy. Worn out by sleeplessness and anxiety, they shifted their grief onto each other, reproached each other, and quarreled.

�Petrusha�s here with papers from your father,� the girl whispered. Prince Andrei stepped out.

�Well, what now!� he said crossly and, having listened to the verbal orders from his father and taking the envelopes and his father�s letter, he went back to the nursery.

�Well, how is he?� asked Prince Andrei.

�Still the same, just wait, for God�s sake. Karl Ivanych always says that sleep is best of all,� Princess Marya whispered with a sigh. Prince Andrei went over to the baby and felt him. He was burning.

�Devil take you and your Karl Ivanych!� He picked up the glass with the drops of medicine in it and went back again.

�Andr&#233;, don�t!� said Princess Marya.

But he glowered at her angrily and at the same time sufferingly, and bent over the baby with the glass.

�But I want it,� he said. �Well, give it to him, I beg you.�

Princess Marya shrugged her shoulders, but took the glass obediently and, calling to the nanny, began to administer the medicine. The baby cried and wheezed. Prince Andrei, wincing, clutched his head, went out, and sat on a sofa in the next room.

He still had the letters in his hand. He opened them mechanically and began to read. On blue paper, in his large, elongated hand, occasionally using abbreviations, the old prince wrote the following:

I have this moment received most joyful news through a courier. If it is not a lie, Bennigsen is supposed to have won a full victory over Bonapartius at Preussisch-Eylau. In Petersburg there is general rejoicing, and no end of rewards have been sent to the army. Though he is a German, I congratulate him. The commander in Korchevo, a certain Khandrikov, is doing something I cannot fathom: up to now additional men and provisions have not been delivered. Gallop there at once and tell him that his head will roll unless everything is done within a week. I have also received a letter about the battle of Preussisch-Eylau from Petenka, who took part in it�everything is true. When those who should not interfere do not interfere, even a German can beat Bonapartius. They say he is fleeing in great disarray. See that you gallop to Korchevo without delay and carry out my orders!

Prince Andrei sighed and opened another envelope. This was a two-page, closely written letter from Bilibin. He folded it without reading it and read his father�s letter again, ending with the words: �Gallop to Korchevo and carry out my orders!�

�No, excuse me, I won�t go now, not until the baby gets well,� he thought and, going to the door, he peeked into the nursery. Princess Marya was still standing by the crib, gently rocking the baby.

�Yes, what�s that other unpleasantness he writes?� Prince Andrei recalled the contents of his father�s letter. �Yes. Our side has won a victory over Bonaparte precisely when I�m not serving. Yes, yes, he keeps making fun of me�well, he�s welcome to�� And he began to read Bilibin�s letter, written in French. He read, not understanding half of it, read only so as to stop thinking for at least a minute about what he had been thinking of exclusively and painfully for all too long.


IX

Bilibin was now attached to army headquarters in the capacity of a diplomatic functionary, and though he wrote in French, with French jokes and turns of phrase, he described the whole campaign with an exclusively Russian fearlessness of self-condemnation and self-derision. Bilibin wrote that his diplomatic discr&#233;tion tormented him, and that he was happy to have a faithful correspondent in Prince Andrei, before whom he could pour out all the bile that had accumulated in him while watching what was happening in the army. The letter was an old one, from before the battle of Preussisch-Eylau. Bilibin wrote:

Depuis nos grands succ&#232;s d�Austerlitz vous savez, mon cher Prince, que je ne quitte plus les quartiers g&#233;n&#233;raux. D&#233;cid&#233;ment j�ai pris le go&#251;t de la guerre, et bien m�en a pris. Ce que j�ai vu ces trois mois, est incroyable.

Je commence ab ovo. �L�ennemi du genre humain,� comme vous savez, s�attaque aux Prussiens. Les Prussiens sont nos fid&#232;les alli&#233;s, qui ne nous ont tromp&#233;s que trois fois depuis trois ans. Nous prenons fait et cause pour eux. Mais il se trouve que l�ennemi du genre humain ne fait nulle attention &#224; nos beaux discours, et avec sa mani&#232;re impolie et sauvage se jette sur les Prussiens sans leur donner le temps de finir la parade commenc&#233;e, en deux tours de main les rosse &#224; plate couture et va s�installer au palais de Potsdam.

�J�ai le plus vif d&#233;sir,� &#233;crit le Roi de Prusse &#224; Bonaparte, �que V. M. soit accueillie et trait&#233;e dans mon palais d�une mani&#232;re, qui lui soit agr&#233;able et c�est avec empressement, que j�ai pris &#224; cet effet toutes les mesures que les circonstances me permettaient. Puisse-je avoir r&#233;ussi!� Les g&#233;n&#233;raux Prussiens se piquent de politesse envers les Fran&#231;ais et mettent bas les armes aux premi&#232;res sommations.

Le chef de la garnison de Glogau avec dix mille hommes demande au Roi de Prusse, ce qu�il doit faire s�il est somm&#233; de se rendre?�Tout cela est positif.

Bref, esp&#233;rant en imposer seulement par notre attitude militaire, il se trouve que nous voil&#224; en guerre pour tout de bon, et ce qui plus est, en guerre sur nos fronti&#232;res avec et pour le Roi de Prusse. Tout est au grand complet, il ne nous manque qu�une petite chose, c�est le g&#233;n&#233;ral en chef. Comme il s�est trouv&#233; que les succ&#232;s d�Austerlitz auraient pu &#234;tre plus d&#233;cisifs si le g&#233;n&#233;ral en chef eut &#233;t&#233; moins jeune, on fait la revue des octog&#233;naires et entre Prosorofsky et Kamensky, on donne la pr&#233;f&#233;rence au dernier. Le g&#233;n&#233;ral nous arrive en kibik &#224; la mani&#232;re de Souvoroff, et est accueilli avec des acclamations de joie et de triomphe.

Le 4 arrive le premier courrier de P&#233;tersbourg. On apporte les malles dans le cabinet du mar&#233;chal, qui aime &#224; faire tout par lui-m&#234;me. On m�appelle pour aider &#224; faire le triage des lettres et prendre celles qui nous sont destin&#233;es. Le mar&#233;chal nous regarde faire et attend les paquets qui lui sont adress&#233;s. Nous cherchons�il n�y en a point. Le mar&#233;chal devient impatient, se met lui-m&#234;me &#224; la besogne et trouve des lettres de l�Empereur pour le comte T., pour le prince V. et autres. Alors le voil&#224; qui se met dans une de ses col&#232;res bleues. Il jette feu et flamme contre tout le monde, s�empare des lettres, les decach&#232;te, et lit celles de l�Empereur adress&#233;es &#224; d�autres. �Ah, so that�s how they deal with me. They don�t trust me! Ah, there�s an order to keep an eye on me�very well, away with you!� Et il &#233;crit le fameux ordre du jour au g&#233;n&#233;ral Bennigsen.

�I am wounded, I cannot mount a horse, and therefore cannot command an army. You have brought your crushed corps d�arm&#233;e to Pultusk: here it is exposed, without firewood, and without forage, and thus in need of help, and since you yourself were in touch with Count Buxh&#246;wden yesterday, thought should be given to retreating to our border, which should be done today.�

�From all this riding around,� &#233;crit-il &#224; l�Empereur, �I have got a saddle sore, which, on top of my previous bandages, totally prevents me from riding and commanding such a vast army, and therefore I have turned over the command to the general next in seniority to myself, Count Buxh&#246;wden, sending him all my staff and everything pertaining to it, advising them, if there is no bread, to retreat further into the interior of Prussia, because there was only enough bread left for one day, and some regiments had none, as division commanders Ostermann and Sedmoretsky announced, and everything the peasants had has been eaten; and I myself am staying in a hospital in Ostrolenka until I am cured. Your most devoted servant submits this report, dating it, and observing that if the army remains in its present bivouac for another two weeks, by spring we will not have one healthy man left.

�Dismiss an old man to his country estates, who is left disgraced as it is that he cannot fulfill the great and glorious destiny for which he was chosen. I shall await your most merciful permission here in the hospital, to avoid playing the role of a scrivener rather than a commander of troops. My removal from the army will cause no greater stir than if a blind man was leaving it. There are thousands like me in Russia.�

Le mar&#233;chal se f&#226;che contre l�Empereur et nous punit tous; n�est-ce pas que c�est logique!

Voil&#224; le premier acte. Aux suivants l�inter&#234;t et le ridicule montent comme de raison. Apr&#232;s le d&#233;part du mar&#233;chal il se trouve que nous sommes en vue de l�ennemi, et qu�il faut livrer bataille. Boukshevden est g&#233;n&#233;ral en chef par droit d�anciennet&#233;, mais g&#233;n&#233;ral Bennigsen n�est pas de cet avis; d�autant plus qu�il est lui, avec son corps en vue de l�ennemi, et qu�il veut profiter de l�occasion d�une bataille �aus eigener Hand,� comme disent les Allemands.

Il la donne. C�est la bataille de Poultousk qui est sens&#233;e &#234;tre une grande victoire, mais qui &#224; mon avis ne l�est pas du tout. Nous autres p&#233;kins avons comme vous savez, une tr&#232;s vilaine habitude de d&#233;cider du gain ou de la perte d�une bataille. Celui qui s�est retir&#233; apr&#232;s la bataille, l�a perdu, voil&#224; ce que nous disons, et &#224; titre nous avons perdu la bataille de Poultousk. Bref, nous nous retirons apr&#232;s la bataille, mais nous envoyons un courrier &#224; P&#233;tersbourg, qui porte les nouvelles d�une victoire, et le g&#233;n&#233;ral ne c&#232;de pas le commandement en chef &#224; Boukshevden, esp&#233;rant recevoir de P&#233;tersbourg en reconnaissance de sa victoire le titre de g&#233;n&#233;ral en chef. Pendant cet interr&#232;gne, nous commen&#231;ons un plan de manoeuvres excessivement int&#233;ressant et original. Notre but ne consiste pas, comme il devrait l�&#234;tre, &#224; &#233;viter ou &#224; attaquer l�ennemi; mais uniquement &#224; &#233;viter le g&#233;n&#233;ral Boukshevden, qui par droit d�anciennet&#233; serait notre chef. Nous poursuivons ce but avec tant d�&#233;nergie, que m&#234;me en passant une rivi&#232;re qui n�est pas gu&#233;able, nous br&#251;lons les ponts pour nous s&#233;parer de notre ennemi, qui pour le moment, n�est pas Bonaparte, mais Boukshevden. Le g&#233;n&#233;ral Boukshevden a manqu&#233; d�&#234;tre attaqu&#233; et pris par des forces ennemies sup&#233;rieures &#224; cause d�une de nos belles manoeuvres qui nous sauvait de lui. Boukshevden nous poursuit�nous filons. &#192; peine passe-t-il de notre c&#244;t&#233; de la rivi&#232;re, que nous repassons de l�autre. &#192; la fin notre ennemi Boukshevden nous attrappe et s�attaque &#224; nous. Les deux g&#233;n&#233;raux se f&#226;chent. Il y a m&#234;me une provocation en duel de la part de Boukshevden et une attaque d�&#233;pilepsie de la part de Bennigsen. Mais au moment critique le courrier, qui porte la nouvelle de notre victoire de Poultousk, nous apporte de P&#233;tersbourg notre nomination de g&#233;n&#233;ral en chef, et le premier ennemi Boukshevden est enfonc&#233;: nous pouvons penser au second, &#224; Bonaparte. Mais ne voil&#224;-t-il pas qu�a ce moment se l&#232;ve devant nous un troisi&#232;me ennemi, c�est les Orthodox Armed Forces qui demande &#224; grands cris du pain, de la viande, des souchary, du foin�que sais-je! Les magasins sont vides, les chemins impraticables. Les Orthodox Armed Forces se met &#224; la maraude, et d�une mani&#232;re dont la derni&#232;re campagne ne peut vous donner la moindre id&#233;e. La moiti&#233; des r&#233;giments forme des troupes libres, qui parcourent la contr&#233;e en mettant tout &#224; feu et &#224; sang. Les habitants sont ruin&#233;s de fond en comble, les h&#244;pitaux regorgent de malades, et la disette est partout. Deux fois le quartier g&#233;n&#233;ral a &#233;t&#233; attaqu&#233; par des troupes de maraudeurs et le g&#233;n&#233;ral en chef a &#233;t&#233; oblig&#233; lui-m&#234;me de demander un bataillon, pour les chasser. Dans une de ces attaques on m�a emport&#233; ma malle vide et ma robe de chambre. L�Empereur veut donner droit &#224; tous les chefs de division de fusiller les maraudeurs, mais je crains fort que cela n�oblige une moiti&#233; de l�arm&#233;e de fusiller l�autre.

Prince Andrei began by reading with his eyes alone, but then involuntarily (though he knew how far Bilibin was to be trusted) became more and interested in what he was reading. Having read to this point, he crumpled the letter and threw it down. It was not what he read in the letter that made him angry; what made him angry was that the life there, now foreign to him, could excite him. He closed his eyes, rubbed his forehead with his hand, as if driving away all concern for what he had read, and began listening to what was happening in the nursery. Suddenly he seemed to hear some strange noise behind the door. Fear came over him; he was afraid something had happened to the baby while he was reading the letter. He tiptoed to the door of the nursery and opened it.

The moment he went in, he saw that the nanny was hiding something from him with a frightened look, and that Princess Marya was no longer by the crib.

�My friend,� he heard behind him what sounded like the desperate whisper of Princess Marya. As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, a groundless fear came over him: it occurred to him that the baby had died. Everything he saw and heard seemed to him to confirm his fear.

�It�s all over,� he thought, and cold sweat broke out on his forehead. Bewildered, he went over to the crib, certain that he would find it empty, that the nanny was hiding the dead baby. He opened the curtain, and for a time his frightened, unfocused eyes could not find the baby. At last he saw him: the red-cheeked boy lay sprawled across the crib, his head lower than the pillow, smacking and moving his lips in his sleep, and breathing regularly.

Prince Andrei, on seeing the boy, was as glad as if he had already lost him. He bent down and, as his sister had taught him, tested with his lips whether the baby had a fever. The tender forehead was moist; he touched his head with his hand�even the hair was wet: the baby had sweated so much. Not only had he not died, but it was obvious now that the crisis was past and that he was getting well. Prince Andrei wanted to snatch up, to squeeze, to clutch to his heart this helpless little being; he did not dare to do it. He stood over him, gazed at his head, his arms, his legs outlined under the blanket. He heard a rustling beside him, and some shadow appeared under the canopy of the crib. He did not turn and, gazing at the baby�s face, kept listening to his regular breathing. The dark shadow was Princess Marya, who had come over to the crib with inaudible steps, raised the canopy, and lowered it behind her. Prince Andrei recognized her without turning to look, and reached his hand towards her. She pressed his hand.

�He�s been sweating,� said Prince Andrei.

�I was coming to tell you that.�

The baby stirred slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead against the pillow.

Prince Andrei looked at his sister. Princess Marya�s luminous eyes, in the dim half-light of the canopy, glistened more than usual from the happy tears that welled up in them. Princess Marya leaned towards her brother and kissed him, catching slightly in the canopy of the crib. They shook their fingers at each other and stood a little longer in the dim light of the canopy, as if reluctant to part with that world in which the three of them were separated from everything on earth. Prince Andrei was the first to leave the crib, his hair tangling in the muslin of the canopy. �Yes, this is the one thing left to me now,� he said with a sigh.

Soon after he was received into the brotherhood of the Masons, Pierre left for the province of Kiev, where the greater part of his peasants were, with a full set of instructions he had written out for himself about what he was to do on his estates.

On reaching Kiev, Pierre summoned all his stewards to the main office and explained his intentions and wishes to them. He told them that measures would immediately be taken for the complete liberation of the peasants from bondage, that meanwhile the peasants should not be overburdened with work, that women with children should not be sent to work, that the peasants should be given assistance, that punishments should be administered hortatorily, not corporeally, that there should be hospitals, almshouses, and schools in each village. Some of the stewards (there were half-literate managers among them) listened fearfully, taking what he said to imply that the young count was displeased with their stewardship and their concealing of money; others, after the first fright, were amused by Pierre�s lisp and the new words they had never heard before; a third group simply took pleasure in hearing how the master spoke; a fourth group, the most intelligent, the head steward among them, understood from his speech how they ought to treat the master in order to achieve their own aims.

The head steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre�s intentions; but he observed that, besides these transformations, it was generally necessary to take care of things, which were in a bad state.

Despite Count Bezukhov�s enormous wealth, ever since Pierre had received it�and he received, so it was said, a yearly income of five hundred thousand�he had felt himself much less rich than when he had received his ten thousand from the late count. In general terms he was vaguely aware of the following budget. Around eighty thousand was paid to the Council for all the estates; around thirty thousand went to the upkeep of the suburban Moscow estate, the Moscow house, and the princesses; around fifteen thousand was distributed in pensions and the same amount to charitable institutions; a hundred and fifty thousand was sent to the countess for her expenses; around seventy thousand was paid as interest on debts; the building of a new church, already begun, had been costing around ten thousand over the past two years; the rest, around a hundred thousand, got spent, he did not know how himself, and he was obliged to borrow almost every year. Besides that, every year the head steward wrote now about fires, now about poor harvests, now about the necessity of rebuilding mills and factories. And so, the first thing facing Pierre was that for which he had least ability or inclination�business matters.

Every day Pierre busied himself with his head steward. But he felt that his busying did not move things one step foward. He felt that his busying went on independently of things, that it did not mesh with things and did not make them move. On the one hand, the head steward, presenting things in the worst light, showed Pierre the necessity of paying off debts and undertaking new works using serf labor, to which Pierre would not agree; on the other hand, Pierre demanded a start to the business of liberation, against which the steward advanced the necessity of first paying the debt to the Trust Council, and hence the impossibility of a speedy liberation.

The steward did not say it was completely impossible; to achieve that goal, he suggested selling the woodlands in Kostroma province, selling the bottomlands and the Crimean estate. But all these operations, as the steward spoke of them, became bound up with such a complexity of processes of lifting prohibitions, requesting permissions, and so on, that Pierre was at a loss and only said to him: �Yes, yes, do that.�

Pierre did not have the practical tenacity that would have given him the possibility of undertaking the business directly, and therefore he did not like it, and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was occupied with it. And the steward tried to pretend to the count that he considered this occupation quite useful for the master and inconvenient for himself.

In the big town acquaintances turned up; strangers hastened to make the acquaintance and greet cordially the newly arrived rich man, the biggest proprietor in the province. Temptations in connection with Pierre�s main weakness, the one he had confessed when he was being received into the lodge, were also so strong that Pierre could not resist them. Again whole days, weeks, months of Pierre�s life passed busily taken up with soir&#233;es, dinners, lunches, balls, giving him no time to recover his senses, just as in Petersburg. Instead of the new life Pierre had hoped to lead, he still lived the same life as before, only in different surroundings.

Of the three precepts of Masonry, Pierre realized that he was not fulfilling the one which required every Mason to be an example of the moral life, and of the seven virtues he was totally lacking in two: good character and the love of death. He comforted himself by thinking that he was fulfilling another duty instead�the setting to rights of the human race�and had other virtues�love of his neighbor and, especially, generosity.

In the spring of 1807, Pierre decided to go back to Petersburg. On the way back he intended to visit all his estates and personally ascertain what of all he had prescribed had been done, and what the situation now was of the people whom God had entrusted to him and whose benefactor he was trying to be.

The steward�who considered all the young count�s ventures near madness, unprofitable for himself, for Pierre, and for the peasants�made concessions. Continuing to present the business of emancipation as impossible, he ordered the construction of large buildings for schools, hospitals, and almshouses on all the estates; had receptions prepared everywhere for the master�s arrival, not sumptuously festive, which he knew Pierre would not like, but of religious thanksgiving, with icons and bread and salt, precisely such as would impress and deceive the master, as he understood him.

The southern spring, the comfortable, quick travel in a Viennese carriage, and the solitude on the way worked joyfully on Pierre. The estates he had not yet been to were one more picturesque than the other; the people everywhere seemed prosperous and touchingly grateful for the benefactions he had done them. Everywhere there were welcomes, which, though they sometimes embarrassed Pierre, at the bottom of his heart called up a joyful feeling in him. In one place the peasants offered him bread and salt and the icon of Peter and Paul, and asked his permission, in honor of his patron saints Peter and Paul, as a sign of love and gratitude for his benefactions, to build a new chapel in the church at their own expense. In another place he was met by women with nursing babies, who thanked him for their deliverance from hard work. On a third estate he was met by the priest with a cross, surrounded by children whom, thanks to the count, he was instructing in reading, writing, and religion. On all the estates Pierre saw with his own eyes stone buildings under construction or already constructed according to the same plan, to serve as hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were to be opened in a short time. Everywhere Pierre saw the stewards� reports on the reduction of the corv&#233;e compared to previous norms and heard touching thanks for it from deputations of peasants in blue kaftans.

Pierre did not know that the village where he was offered bread and salt and where a chapel to Peter and Paul was being built was a market village with a fair on St. Peter�s Day, that the chapel had been begun long ago by the wealthy peasants, who were the ones that welcomed him, and that nine-tenths of the peasants in that village were completely destitute. He did not know that since, on his orders, women with nursing babies were no longer sent to do corv&#233;e, these same women had to do still harder work on their own land. He did not know that the priest who met him with the cross burdened the peasants with his exactions and that the pupils gathered around him had been sent off with tears by their parents and were bought back for large sums of money. He did not know that the stone buildings were constructed to plan by his own workers and increased their corv&#233;e, which was only reduced on paper. He did not know that where a steward showed him in the books that the quitrent had been reduced by a third, as he had ordered, the corv&#233;e had been augmented by half. And therefore Pierre was delighted by his visits to the estates and returned fully to that philanthropic state of mind in which he had left Petersburg, and wrote rapturous letters to his mentor-brother, as he called the grand master.

�How easy it is, how little effort it takes, to do so much good,� thought Pierre, �and how little we care about it!�

He was happy with the gratitude shown him, but ashamed as he received it. This gratitude reminded him how much more he could do for these simple, good people.

The steward, a very stupid but cunning man, understood the intelligent but na&#239;ve count perfectly and played with him as with a toy. When he saw the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre, he addressed him more resolutely with arguments about the impossibility and, above all, the needlessness of emancipating the peasants, who were perfectly happy even without that.

In his heart of hearts Pierre agreed with the steward that it was hard to imagine happier people and that God knows what awaited them in freedom; yet Pierre insisted, albeit reluctantly, on what he considered right. The steward promised to put all his powers to use in fulfilling the count�s will, clearly understanding that the count not only would never be able to check on whether all the measures had been taken for selling the woodlands and estates, so as to pay off the Council, but would probably never ask and never find out that the buildings constructed were standing empty and that the peasants went on giving in work and money all that peasants gave other masters�that is, all they could.


XI

Returning from his southern journey in the happiest state of mind, Pierre carried out a long-standing intention of his�to go and visit his friend Bolkonsky, whom he had not seen for two years.

Having learned at the last posting station that Prince Andrei was not at Bald Hills, but at his newly allotted estate, Pierre went to him there.

Bogucharovo lay in flat, unattractive country covered with fields and first- and second-growth stands of fir and birch. The manor stood at the end of a village that stretched along the high road, behind a newly dug, well-filled pond, its banks not yet overgrown with grass, in the middle of a young woods, amidst which stood a few big pines.

The manor consisted of a threshing floor, outbuildings, stables, a bathhouse, a cottage, and a big stone house with a semicircular fa&#231;ade, which was still under construction. Around the house a young garden was planted. The fences were sturdy and new; under a shed stood two fire hoses and a barrel painted green; the paths were straight, the bridges strong, with handrails. Everything bore the stamp of neatness and efficiency. To the question of where the prince lived, some domestics he met pointed him to the small, new cottage that stood just by the pond. Anton, Prince Andrei�s old tutor, helped Pierre out of the carriage, said that the prince was at home, and led him to a clean little front hall.

Pierre was struck by the modesty of this small though clean house, after those magnificent conditions in which he had last seen his friend in Petersburg. He went quickly into the little reception room, unplastered and still smelling of pine, and wanted to go further, but Anton ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked on the door.

�Well, what is it?� came a sharp, unpleasant voice.

�A visitor,� replied Anton.

�Ask him to wait,� and there was the sound of a chair being moved. Pierre went up to the door with quick steps and ran face-to-face into the frowning and aged Prince Andrei, who was coming out to him. Pierre embraced him and, raising his spectacles, kissed him on the cheeks and looked at him close up.

�How unexpected, I�m very glad,� said Prince Andrei. Pierre said nothing; he looked at his friend in astonishment and could not take his eyes off him. He was struck by the change that had taken place in Prince Andrei. His words were affectionate, there was a smile on Prince Andrei�s lips and face, but his gaze was extinguished, dead, and despite his obvious desire, Prince Andrei could not give it a joyful and merry luster. It was not that his friend had grown thinner, paler, more mature; it was this gaze and the wrinkle on his forehead, expressive of a long concentration on some one thing, which struck and alienated Pierre, until he got used to them.

In this meeting after a long separation, as always happens, the conversation could not settle on anything for a long time; they asked and gave brief replies about things they knew should have been discussed at length. At last the conversation gradually began to dwell on what had previously been said in fragments, on questions of past life, on plans for the future, on Pierre�s journey, on his occupations, on the war, and so on. The concentration and dejection Pierre had noticed in Prince Andrei�s eyes were now expressed still more strongly in the smile with which he listened to Pierre, especially when Pierre spoke with animated joy about his past or future. It was as if Prince Andrei would have liked to enter into what he was saying, but could not. Pierre was beginning to feel that raptures, dreams, hopes for happiness and the good were improper in front of Prince Andrei. He was ashamed to voice all his new Masonic thoughts, especially renewed and stirred up in him by his last journey. He restrained himself, he was afraid of being na&#239;ve; along with that he had an irrepressible desire to show his friend the more quickly that he was now quite a different, better Pierre than the one he had been in Petersburg.

�I can�t tell you how much I�ve lived through in this time. I wouldn�t recognize myself.�

�Yes, we�ve changed very much, very much, since then,� said Prince Andrei.

�Well, and you?� asked Pierre. �What are your plans?�

�Plans?� Prince Andrei repeated ironically. �My plans?� he repeated, as if astonished at the meaning of such a word. �As you see, I�m building, by next year I want to have moved completely��

Pierre peered silently and intently into Andrei�s aged face.

�No, I�m asking�� said Pierre, but Prince Andrei interrupted him:

�Why talk about myself�you tell me, tell me about your journey and all you did there on your estates.�

Pierre began telling about what he had done on his estates, trying as far as possible to hide his own share in the improvements he had made. Prince Andrei prompted Pierre beforehand several times in what he was telling, as if everything Pierre had done was a long-known story, and he listened not only without interest, but even as if ashamed at what Pierre was telling him.

Pierre felt awkward and even oppressed in his friend�s company. He fell silent.

�Well, the thing is, dear heart,� said Prince Andrei, who obviously also felt oppressed and embarrassed with his visitor, �I�m on bivouac here, I�ve just come to have a look. And tonight I�m going to my sister�s. I�ll introduce you to them. But it seems you know her,� he said, obviously entertaining a visitor with whom he no longer felt anything in common. �We�ll go after dinner. And now would you like to look over my estate?� They went out and spent the time before dinner discussing political news and mutual acquaintances, like people who have little closeness to each other. Prince Andrei showed some animation and interest only when he talked about the new estate he was setting up and his construction projects, but here, too, in the midst of the conversation, on the scaffolding, as Prince Andrei was describing to Pierre the future layout of the house, he suddenly stopped. �However, there�s nothing interesting in it, let�s have dinner and go.� Over dinner the conversation turned to Pierre�s marriage.

�I was very surprised when I heard of it,� said Prince Andrei.

Pierre blushed, as he always blushed about that, and said hastily:

�Some day I�ll tell you how it all happened. But, you know, it�s all over, and forever.�

�Forever?� said Prince Andrei. �Nothing is forever.�

�But you do know how it all ended? You heard about the duel?�

�Yes, you went through that, too.�

�The one thing I thank God for is that I didn�t kill the man,� said Pierre.

�Why so?� asked Prince Andrei. �It�s even very good to kill a vicious dog.�

�No, to kill a man is bad, it�s wrong��

�Why is it wrong?� Prince Andrei repeated. �It�s not given to people to judge what�s right or wrong. People have eternally been mistaken and will be mistaken, and in nothing more so than in what they consider right and wrong.�

�What�s evil for another person is wrong,� said Pierre, pleased to feel that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrei was becoming animated and was beginning to talk and wanted to speak out everything that had made him the way he was now.

�But who has told you what�s evil for another person?� he asked.

�Evil? Evil?� said Pierre. �We all know what�s evil for us.�

�Yes, we know, but what I know as evil for myself, I cannot do to another person,� Prince Andrei was speaking more and more animatedly, clearly wishing to voice his new view of things to Pierre. He spoke in French. �Je ne connais dans la vie que deux maux bien r&#233;els: c�est le remords et la maladie. Il n�est de bien que l�absence de ces maux. To live for myself, only avoiding these two evils�that is all my wisdom now.�

�And love of one�s neighbor, and self-sacrifice?� Pierre began. �No, I can�t agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil, so as not to repent, is too little. I used to live that way, I lived for myself, and I ruined my life. And only now, when I live, or at least try to live� (Pierre corrected himself out of modesty) �for others, only now have I understood all the happiness of life. No, I won�t agree with you, and you don�t really think what you�re saying.� Prince Andrei silently gazed at Pierre with a mocking smile.

�You�ll be seeing my sister, Princess Marya. You�ll get along well with her,� he said. �Maybe you�re right for yourself,� he went on after a brief pause, �but each man lives in his own way: you lived for yourself and you say with that you almost ruined your life, and knew happiness only when you began to live for others. But I experienced the opposite. I used to live for glory. (What is glory? The same as love for others, the desire to do something for them, the desire for their praise.) So I lived for others and ruined my life�and not almost, but completely. And I�ve been at peace since I began living for myself alone.�

�But how can you live for yourself alone?� asked Pierre, becoming heated. �What about your son, your sister, your father?�

�But they�re the same as myself, they�re not others,� said Prince Andrei, �and others, one�s �neighbors,� le prochain, as you and Princess Marya call them, are the chief source of error and evil. Le prochain�that�s those Kievan peasants of yours, to whom you want to do good.�

And he gave Pierre a mockingly defiant look. He was clearly defying Pierre.

�You�re joking,� said Pierre, growing more and more animated. �What error and evil can there be in my wish (though fulfilled very little and poorly), my wish to do good, and in my doing at least something? What evil can there be if those wretched people, our peasants, people like us, who grow up and die with no other notion of God and truth than an icon and a meaningless prayer, are taught comforting beliefs about the future life, retribution, reward, comfort? What evil and error are there if people are dying of disease without any help, when it�s so easy to help them materially, and I give them a doctor, and a hospital, and a shelter for the aged? And isn�t it a palpable, unquestionable good if a peasant or a woman with a baby has no peace day or night, and I give them rest and leisure?�� said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. �And I�ve done that, though poorly, though very little, but I�ve done something to that end, and you not only won�t convince me that what I�ve done was not good, but you also won�t convince me that you don�t think so yourself. And above all,� Pierre went on, �this I know and know for certain, that the pleasure of doing good is the only certain happiness in life.�

�Yes, if you put the question that way, it�s another matter,� said Prince Andrei. �I build a house and cultivate a garden, and you build hospitals. Both can serve to pass the time. But what�s right, what�s good�that is for the one who knows all to judge, not for us. Well, you want to argue,� he added, �so let�s argue.� They left the table and sat on the porch, which took the place of a balcony.

�Well, let�s argue, then,� said Prince Andrei. �Schools, you say,� he went on, raising a finger, �instruction, and so on�that is, you want to lead him out of his animal condition,� he said, pointing to a muzhik who took off his hat as he passed by, �and give him moral needs. But it seems to me that the only possible happiness is animal happiness, and you want to deprive him of it. I envy him and you want to make him into me, but without giving him my intelligence, or my feelings, or my means. Second, you say lighten his work. But in my opinion physical labor is as much a necessity for him, as much a condition of his existence, as mental labor is for you and me. You cannot not think. I go to bed past two o�clock, I have thoughts and can�t sleep, I toss about, I don�t fall asleep until morning, because I�m thinking and cannot not think, as he cannot not plow or mow�otherwise he�ll go to the pot-house or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical labor and would die in a week, so he could not stand my physical idleness, he�d grow fat and die. Third�what was it you said?�

Prince Andrei raised a third finger.

�Ah, yes. Hospitals, medicines. He has a stroke, he�s dying, but you let his blood, you cure him, and he�ll go around crippled for another ten years, a burden on everyone. It�s far more simple and easy for him to die. Others will be born, there are lots of them as it is. You might be sorry to lose an extra worker�that�s how I look at him�but no, you want to cure him out of love for him. And he doesn�t need that. Besides, what is this fantasy that medicine has ever cured anybody�Killed, yes!� he said, frowning spitefully and turning away from Pierre.

Prince Andrei spoke his mind so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he had thought about it more than once, and he spoke eagerly and quickly, like a man who has not spoken for a long time. His gaze became the more animated, the more hopeless his opinions were.

�Ah, that�s terrible, terrible!� said Pierre. �Only I don�t understand how one can live with such thoughts. Such moments have come over me, it was not long ago, in Moscow and on the road, but then I go so much to seed that I don�t live, I find everything vile, above all myself. I don�t eat then, don�t wash�well, how is it with you��

�Why don�t you wash, it�s not clean,� said Prince Andrei. �On the contrary, one must try to make one�s life as pleasant as possible. I�m alive and it�s not my fault, which means I must somehow go on living the best I can, without bothering anybody, until I die.�

�But what makes you live? With such thoughts, you�ll sit without moving, without undertaking anything��

�Life won�t leave one alone as it is. I�d be glad to do nothing, but then, on the one hand, the local nobility deemed me worthy of being elected their marshal; I barely got out of it. They couldn�t understand that I don�t have what it takes, don�t have the sort of good-natured and bustling banality needed for it. Then there�s this house, which had to be built so as to have a corner where I could be at peace. Now it�s the militia.�

�Why aren�t you serving in the army?�

�After Austerlitz!� Prince Andrei said gloomily. �No, I humbly thank you, I promised myself that I would not serve in the active Russian army. And I won�t. If Bonaparte was camped here in Smolensk, threatening Bald Hills, even then I wouldn�t serve in the Russian army. Well, as I was saying,� Prince Andrei went on, calming down. �Now it�s the militia, my father is commander in chief of the third district, and my only means of avoiding service is to be with him.�

�Which means you do serve?�

�I do.� He paused briefly.

�So why do you serve?�

�Here�s why. My father is one of the most remarkable men of his time. But he�s getting old, and it�s not that he�s cruel, but he has all too active a character. He�s frightening in his habit of unlimited power and now with this power bestowed on him by the sovereign as a commander in chief of the militia. If I had been two hours late a couple of weeks ago, he would have hanged a protocolist in Yukhnovo,� Prince Andrei said with a smile. �So I serve because no one except for me has any influence on my father, and at some point I may have to save him from an act from which he might suffer later.�

�Ah, well, so you see!�

�Yes, mais ce n�est pas comme vous l�entendez,� Prince Andrei went on. �I never wished, nor do I wish now, any good to that scoundrel of a protocolist, who stole some boots from the militiamen; I�d even be very pleased to see him hanged, but I pity my father�that is, again, myself.�

Prince Andrei was becoming more and more animated. His eyes shone feverishly all the while he was trying to prove to Pierre that there never was any wish for his neighbor�s good in his action.

�Well, here you want to emancipate the peasants,� he went on. �That�s very good; but not for you (I suppose you�ve never whipped anyone to death or sent them to Siberia), and still less for the peasants. If they�re beaten, whipped, and sent to Siberia, I don�t think that makes it any worse for them. In Siberia he�ll go on with his brutish life, and the welts on his body will heal, and he�ll be as happy as he was before. But it�s needed for those people who are morally ruined, live to repent it, suppress this repentance, and turn coarse, because they have the possibility of punishing justly and unjustly. Those are the ones I pity and for whose sake I would wish for the emancipation of the peasants. Maybe you haven�t seen it, but I�ve seen good people brought up in this tradition of unlimited power, as they become more irritated over the years, become cruel, coarse, know it, can�t help themselves, and become more and more unhappy.�

Prince Andrei said this with such enthusiasm that it involuntarily occurred to Pierre that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrei by his father. He made no reply.

�So there is what and whom to be sorry for�human dignity, peace of conscience, purity, and not their backs and heads, which, however much you whip them and shave them, will still remain the same backs and heads.�

�No, no, a thousand times no! I�ll never agree with you,� said Pierre.


XII

In the evening Prince Andrei and Pierre got into a carriage and drove to Bald Hills. Prince Andrei, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence from time to time with speeches which proved that he was in a good state of mind.

Pointing to the fields, he told him about his improvements in management.

Pierre was gloomily silent, answered monosyllabically, and seemed to be immersed in his own thoughts.

Pierre was thinking about Prince Andrei, that he was unhappy, that he was mistaken, that he did not know the true light, that Pierre had come to his aid, to enlighten him and raise him up. But as soon as Pierre thought of how and what he was going to say, he had the feeling that Prince Andrei would discredit his entire teaching with a single word, a single argument, and he was afraid to begin, afraid to expose his favorite, sacred thing to the possibility of ridicule.

�No, why do you think,� Pierre suddenly began, lowering his head and looking like a butting bull, �why do you think that way? You shouldn�t think that way.�

�About what?� Prince Andrei asked in surprise.

�About life, about man�s purpose. It can�t be. I thought the same, and do you know what saved me? Masonry. No, don�t smile. Masonry is not a religious, not a ritual sect, as I also thought, Masonry is the best, the only expression of the best, the eternal sides of mankind.� And he began to explain Masonry to Prince Andrei as he understood it.

He said that Masonry is the teaching of Christianity, freed of state and religious fetters; the teaching of equality, brotherhood, and love.

�Only our holy brotherhood has real meaning in life; all the rest is a dream,� said Pierre. �Understand, my friend, that outside this union everything is filled with lies and falsehood, and I agree with you that an intelligent and good man has nothing left but to live out his life, like you, trying only not to bother others. But adopt our basic convictions, join our brotherhood, give yourself to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I did, a part of this huge, invisible chain, the beginning of which is hidden in heaven,� said Pierre.

Prince Andrei, looking straight ahead, listened silently to Pierre�s speech. A few times he asked Pierre to repeat words he had not heard because of the noise of the carriage. By a particular gleam that lit up in Prince Andrei�s eyes, and by his silence, Pierre saw that his words were not in vain, that Prince Andrei would not interrupt him or laugh at what he was saying.

They approached a flooded river, which they had to cross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being loaded, they boarded the ferry.

Prince Andrei, leaning his elbow on the rail, looked silently down the floodwaters sparkling in the setting sun.

�Well, what do you think about that?� asked Pierre. �Why are you silent?�

�What do I think? I�ve been listening to you. That is all so,� said Prince Andrei. �But you say, �Join our brotherhood, and we�ll show you the goal of life and the purpose of man and the laws that govern the world.� But who are we?�just people. How do you know everything? How is it that I alone do not see what you see? You see the kingdom of the good and the true on earth, and I don�t see it.�

Pierre interrupted him.

�Do you believe in a future life?� he asked.

�A future life?� Prince Andrei repeated, but Pierre gave him no time to reply, and took this repetition for a denial, the more so as he knew Prince Andrei�s former atheistic convictions.

�You say you can�t see the kingdom of the good and the true on earth. I didn�t see it either; and it can�t be seen if you look at our life as the end of everything. On earth, I mean this earth� (Pierre pointed to the fields), �there is no truth�everything is falsehood and evil; but in the universe, in the whole universe, there is the kingdom of the true, and we are now children of the earth, but eternally�children of the whole universe. Don�t I feel in my soul that I make up a part of that huge, harmonious whole? Don�t I feel that, among the countless number of beings in which the divinity�the higher power�whatever you like�is manifest, I make up one link, one step from lower beings to higher? If I see, see clearly, this ladder that leads from plant to man, then why should I suppose that this ladder, the lower end of which I do not see, is lost in the plants? Why should I suppose that this ladder stops with me and does not lead further and further to higher beings? I feel not only that I cannot disappear, as nothing disappears in the world, but that I will always be and have always been. I feel that, besides me, above me, spirits live, and that in this world there is truth.�

�Yes, that�s Herder�s teaching,� said Prince Andrei, �but that, dear heart, does not convince me; life and death are what convince me. What convinces me is to see a being dear to you, who is bound up with you, before whom you were guilty and hoped to vindicate yourself� (Prince Andrei�s voice quavered and he turned away), �and suddenly this being suffers, agonizes, and ceases to be�Why? It cannot be that there�s no answer! And I believe there is one�That is what convinces, that is what has convinced me,� said Prince Andrei.

�Yes, ah, yes,� said Pierre, �and isn�t that the same as what I�m saying?�

�No. All I say is that what convinces one of the necessity of a future life is not arguments, but when one goes through life hand in hand with a person, and suddenly that person disappears there into nowhere, and you yourself stop before that abyss and look into it. And I did look��

�Well, that�s just it! You know there�s a there and there�s a someone? There is the future life. The someone is�God.�

Prince Andrei did not reply. The carriage and horses had long been led out on the other side and hitched up, and the sun had already half disappeared, and the evening frost had covered the pools by the crossing with stars, but Pierre and Andrei, to the astonishment of the lackeys, coachmen, and ferrymen, were still standing on the ferry and talking.

�If there is God and if there is a future life, then there is truth, there is virtue; and man�s highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must live, we must love, we must believe,� said Pierre, �that we do not live only today on this scrap of earth, but have lived and will live eternally there, in the all� (he pointed to the sky). Prince Andrei stood with his elbow resting on the rail of the ferry, and, listening to Pierre, did not take his eyes off the red gleam of the sun on the blue floodwaters. Pierre fell silent. It was completely still. The ferry had long been moored, and only the waves of the current lapped with a faint sound against the ferry�s bottom. It seemed to Prince Andrei that this splash of waves made a refrain to Pierre�s words, saying: �It�s true, believe it.�

Prince Andrei sighed, and with a luminous, childlike, tender gaze looked into the flushed, rapturous face of Pierre, who still felt timid before his superior friend.

�Yes, if only it were so!� he said. �Anyhow, let�s go and get in,� Prince Andrei added and, stepping off the ferry, he looked at the sky Pierre had pointed to, and for the first time since Austerlitz saw that high, eternal sky he had seen as he lay on the battlefield, and something long asleep, something that was best in him, suddenly awakened joyful and young in his soul. This feeling disappeared as soon as Prince Andrei re-entered the habitual conditions of life, but he knew that this feeling, which he did not know how to develop, lived in him. The meeting with Pierre marked an epoch for Prince Andrei, from which began what, while outwardly the same, was in his inner world a new life.


XIII

It was already dusk when Prince Andrei and Pierre drove up to the main entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they were driving up, Prince Andrei, smiling, drew Pierre�s attention to the bustling that was going on by the back porch. A bent old woman with a bundle on her back and a short man dressed in black and with long hair, seeing the carriage drive up, went running back to the gate. Two women ran out after them, and all four, glancing at the carriage, ran fearfully up the back porch.

�Those are Masha�s people of God,� said Prince Andrei. �They took us for father. And this is the only thing in which she doesn�t obey him: he orders these wanderers driven away, but she receives them.�

�But what are these people of God?� asked Pierre.

Prince Andrei had no time to answer him. The servants came out to meet them, and he asked them where the old prince was and how soon they expected him.

The old prince was still in town, and he was expected at any moment.

Prince Andrei took Pierre to his rooms, which always awaited him in perfect order in his father�s house, and went himself to the nursery.

�Let�s go to my sister,� said Prince Andrei, returning to Pierre. �I haven�t seen her yet, she�s hiding now and sitting with her people of God. It will serve her right, she�ll get embarrassed, but you�ll see the people of God. C�est curieux, ma parole.�

�Qu�est-ce que c�est que people of God?� asked Pierre.

�You�ll see.�

Princess Marya indeed became embarrassed and covered with red spots when they came to her. In her cozy room, with icon lamps before the icons, a young boy with a long nose and long hair and in a monk�s cassock was sitting on the sofa beside her at the samovar.

In an armchair next to them sat a thin, wrinkled old woman with a meek expression on her childlike face.

�Andr&#233;, pourquoi ne pas m�avoir pr&#233;venu?� she said in mild reproach, standing in front of her wanderers like a hen in front of her chicks.

�Charm&#233;e de vous voir. Je suis tr&#232;s contente de vous voir,� she said to Pierre as he was kissing her hand. She had known him as a child, and now his friendship with Andrei, the misfortune with his wife, and, above all, his kind, simple face disposed her towards him. She looked at him with her beautiful, luminous eyes and seemed to be saying: �I like you very much, but please don�t laugh at my people.� Having exchanged the first phrases of greeting, they sat down.

�Ah, Ivanushka�s here, too,� said Prince Andrei, indicating the young wanderer with his smile.

�Andr&#233;!� Princess Marya said pleadingly.

�Il faut que vous sachiez que c�est une femme,� Andrei said to Pierre.

�Andr&#233;, au nom de Dieu!� Princess Marya repeated.

It was clear that Prince Andrei�s mocking attitude towards the wanderers and Princess Marya�s useless intercession for them were habitual, well-established relations between them.

�Mais, ma bonne amie,� said Prince Andrei, �vous devriez au contraire m�&#234;tre reconnaissante de ce que j�explique &#224; Pierre votre intimit&#233; avec ce jeune homme.�

�Vraiment?� said Pierre, studying the face of Ivanushka curiously and gravely through his spectacles (for which Princess Marya was especially grateful to him). Realizing that they were talking about him, Ivanushka looked around at them all with cunning eyes.

Princess Marya�s embarrassment for her people was totally unnecessary. They were not in the least intimidated. The little old woman, her eyes lowered and casting sidelong glances at the newcomers, turned her teacup bottom up on the saucer and, placing the nibbled piece of sugar beside it, sat calm and motionless in her armchair, waiting to be offered more tea. Ivanushka, sipping from the saucer, looked at the young men from under his brows with his sly feminine eyes.

�Where have you been, to Kiev?� Prince Andrei asked the old woman.

�So I have, good sir,� the old woman replied garrulously. �Just before Christmas I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy, heavenly mysteries with the monks there. And now I�m coming from Kolyazin, where a great blessing has been revealed��

�And Ivanushka has come with you?�

�I�ve come on my own, my provider,� Ivanushka said, trying to speak in a bass voice. �I met Pelageyushka only in Yukhnovo.�

Pelageyushka interrupted her companion; she obviously wanted to tell what she had seen.

�In Kolyazin, good sir, a great blessing has been revealed.�

�What, new relics?� asked Prince Andrei.

�Enough, Andrei,� said Princess Marya. �Don�t tell him, Pelageyushka.�

�And what�s wrong, good lady, why shouldn�t I tell him? I like him. He�s kind. God�s chosen, he gave me ten rubles, my benefactor, I remember. When I was in Kiev, Kiriusha, a holy fool�truly a man of God, he goes barefoot winter and summer��Why do you go about where you don�t belong,� he says, �go to Kolyazin, there�s a miracle-working icon revealed, the holy Mother of God.� At that word I took leave of the monks and went��

Everyone was silent, only the wanderer woman spoke in a measured voice, drawing in her breath.

�I came, my good sir, and people tell me: a great blessing has been revealed, the holy Mother of God has blessed oil dripping from her cheek��

�Well, all right, all right, you can tell it later,� Princess Marya said, blushing.

�Allow me to ask her,� said Pierre. �Did you see it yourself?� he asked.

�Of course, good sir, I was deemed worthy. There was radiance on her face, like a heavenly light, and it dripped from the holy Mother�s cheek, just dripped and dripped��

�But it�s a trick,� Pierre said na&#239;vely, having listened attentively to the wanderer woman.

�Ah, good sir, what are you saying!� Pelageyushka said in horror, turning to Princess Marya for defense.

�They trick the people,� he repeated.

�Lord Jesus Christ,� the wanderer woman said, crossing herself. �Don�t say it, good sir. There was this one gener�l who didn�t believe it and said, �The monks are tricking you.� As soon as he said it, he went blind. And he had a dream that the Mother of God of the Caves comes to him and says: �Believe in me and I will heal you.� So he started begging: �Take me to her, take me.� It�s the real truth I�m telling you, I saw it myself. They brought him, blind as he was, straight to her; he goes to her, falls down, says: �Heal me! I�ll give you everything the tsar has bestowed on me.� I saw the medal myself, a star, set into the icon. So he got his sight back! It�s a sin to speak as you do. God will punish you,� she addressed Pierre didactically.

�How did the star get into the icon?� asked Pierre.

�So the Mother of God has been promoted to general?� said Prince Andrei, smiling.

Pelageyushka suddenly turned pale and clasped her hands.

�Good sir, good sir, it�s a sin, a sin. You have a son!� she began, her pallor suddenly turning to bright red.

�Good sir, what have you said, God forgive you!� She crossed herself. �Lord, forgive him. Good lady, what is this?�� she turned to Princess Marya. She got up and, all but in tears, began packing her bag. She was clearly frightened, and sorry for the one who had said it, and ashamed that she had received benefactions in a house where such things could be said, and sorry that she now had to be deprived of those benefactions.

�Well, what on earth did you do that for?� said Princess Marya. �Why did you come to me?��

�No, I was joking, Pelageyushka,� said Pierre. �Princesse, ma parole, je n�ai pas voulu l�offenser, I just said it. Never mind, I meant it as a joke,� he said, smiling timidly and wishing to smooth over his guilt.

Pelageyushka paused mistrustfully, but Pierre�s face showed such sincere regret and Prince Andrei looked so meekly and gravely now at Pelageyushka, now at Pierre, that she gradually calmed down.


XIV

The wanderer woman calmed down and, urged to go on, spent a long time telling about Father Amphilokhy, whose life was so holy that his dear hand smelled of incense, and about how, during her last pilgrimage to Kiev, some monks she knew gave her the keys to the caves, and how she took some rusks and spent two days in the caves with the saints. �I�d pray to one, recite a little, and go to another. I�d doze, go again and kiss the relics; and it was so quiet, dearie, so blissful, that I didn�t even feel like going out into God�s world.�

Pierre listened to her attentively and gravely. Prince Andrei left the room. And after him, Princess Marya left the people of God to finish their tea and took Pierre to the drawing room.

�You�re very kind,� she said to him.

�Ah, really, I didn�t mean to offend her, I understand those feelings and value them highly.�

Princess Marya silently looked at him and smiled tenderly.

�I�ve known you a long time and love you like a brother,� she said. �How do you find Andrei?� she asked hastily, not giving him time to say anything to her affectionate words. �He worries me very much. This winter his health has improved, but last spring his wound reopened, and the doctor said he should go abroad for treatment. And morally I fear very much for him. He�s not of the same character as us women, who suffer and weep out our grief. He carries it inside him. Today he�s merry and lively; but it�s your arrival that has had that effect on him: he�s rarely that way. If only you could persuade him to go abroad! He needs activity, and this regular, quiet life is ruining him. Others don�t notice, but I see it.�

Towards ten o�clock the manservants rushed out to the porch, hearing the bells of the old prince�s carriage as it drove up. Prince Andrei and Pierre also went out to the porch.

�Who�s that?� the old prince asked, getting out of the carriage and seeing Pierre.

�Ah! Very glad! Kiss me!� he said on learning who the unknown young man was.

The old prince was in good spirits and treated Pierre affectionately.

Before supper Prince Andrei, returning to his father�s study, found the old prince in hot dispute with Pierre. Pierre insisted that a time would come when there would be no more war. The old prince, mockingly, but without getting angry, argued against him.

�Drain the blood from their veins, put in water, then there�ll be no more war. Nonsense, old women�s nonsense,� he said, but even so he patted Pierre affectionately on the shoulder and went over to the desk, where Prince Andrei, evidently unwilling to enter the conversation, was looking through the papers that the old prince had brought from town. The old prince went over to him and began talking about business.

�The marshal, Count Rostov, failed to produce half the men. He came to town and decided to invite me to dinner. I gave him a real dinner�And look at this one�Well, my boy,� Prince Nikolai Andreich said to his son, slapping Pierre on the shoulder, �your friend�s a fine fellow, I�ve come to love him! He fires me up. Another man talks cleverly, and you don�t want to listen to him, but he talks nonsense, yet he fires me up, old as I am. Well, go, go,� he said, �maybe I�ll come and sit with you at supper. And argue again. Love my foolish Princess Marya,� he called to Pierre from the door.

Only now, during his visit to Bald Hills, did Pierre appreciate all the strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrei. This charm expressed itself not so much in his relations with him, as in his relations with the whole family and household. With the severe old prince and the meek and timid Princes Marya, Pierre felt at once like an old friend, though he barely knew them. They all loved him already. Not only did Princess Marya, won over by his meek attitude towards the wanderers, give him her most luminous looks, but the little one-year-old Prince Nikolai, as his grandfather called him, smiled at Pierre and went to his arms. And Mikhail Ivanych and Mlle Bourienne looked at him with joyful smiles when he talked with the old prince.

The old prince came out for supper: this was obviously for Pierre�s sake. He was extremely affectionate with him on both days of his stay at Bald Hills and told him to come to visit.

When Pierre left and all the members of the family came together, they began to discuss him, as always happens after the departure of a new person, and, as rarely happens, they all said only good things about him.


XV

Returning from leave this time, Rostov felt and realized for the first time how strong his bond was with Denisov and the whole regiment.

As Rostov approached the regiment, he experienced a feeling similar to what he had experienced on approaching his house on Povarskaya. When he saw the first hussar in the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment, when he recognized the red-haired Dementyev, saw the red-coated horses at the tethering rail, when Lavrushka shouted joyfully to his master: �The count�s here!��and the disheveled Denisov, who had been asleep in bed, came running out of the dugout, embraced him, and the officers gathered around him, Rostov experienced the same feeling as when his mother, father, and sisters had embraced him, and the tears of joy that welled up in his throat prevented him from speaking. The regiment was also a home, and a home as unchangingly dear and precious as his parental home.

When he had reported to the regimental commander, had obtained an assignment to his former squadron, had been on duty and gone foraging, had entered into all the little concerns of the regiment, and had felt himself deprived of freedom and bound within one narrow, unchanging frame, Rostov experienced the same peace, the same support, and the same awareness that here he was at home, where he belonged, as he felt under the parental roof. There was not all that disorder of the free world, in which he found no place for himself and made wrong choices; there was no Sonya, with whom he had or did not have to talk things over. There was no possibility of going or not going here or there; there were not those twenty-four hours in a day which could be spent in so many different ways; there was no numberless multitude of people, of whom no one was close, no one was distant; there were none of those unclear and undefined money relations with his father; there was no recollection of that terrible loss to Dolokhov! Here in the regiment everything was clear and simple. The whole world was divided into two unequal parts: one was our Pavlogradsky regiment, the other�all the rest. And with this rest he had nothing to do. In the regiment, everything was known: who was a lieutenant, who a captain, who was a good and who a bad man, and�above all�who was a comrade. The sutler gives you credit, your salary comes three times a year; there is nothing to think up or choose between, only do not do anything that is considered bad in the Pavlogradsky regiment; when you are sent out, do what is clearly and distinctly defined and ordered�and all will be well.

Having entered once more into these definite conditions of regimental life, Rostov experienced a joy and peace similar to what a weary man feels when he lies down to rest. This regimental life was the more pleasurable for Rostov during this campaign in that, after losing to Dolokhov (an act for which, despite all his family�s reassurances, he could not forgive himself), he had resolved to serve not as before, but, in order to smooth over his guilt, to serve well and be a perfectly excellent comrade and officer, that is, a fine human being�which seemed so difficult in the world, but so possible in the regiment.

Since the time of his gambling loss, Rostov had resolved to pay back the debt to his parents within five years. They used to send him ten thousand a year, but now he resolved to take only two and leave the rest to his parents in repayment of his debt.

Our army, after repeated retreats, advances, and battles around Pultusk and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting the arrival of the sovereign and the start of a new campaign.

The Pavlogradsky regiment, belonging to that part of the army that had been in the 1805 campaign, had been replenishing its ranks in Russia and was late for the first actions of the campaign. It had not been at Pultusk nor at Preussisch-Eylau, and, joining the active army in the second half of the campaign, was included in Platov�s detachment.

Platov�s detachment acted independently of the army. Several times parts of the Pavlogradsky regiment participated in exchanges of fire with the enemy, took prisoners, and once even captured the carriages of Marshal Oudinot. In the month of April, the regiment camped for several weeks near a totally devastated, empty German village, not budging from the spot.

There was a thaw, mud, cold, the ice on the river broke up, the roads became impassable; for several days provisions had not been issued either to the horses or to the men. Since transport became impossible, men scattered over the abandoned, desolate villages looking for potatoes, but found little even of them.

Everything had been eaten, and the local people had all fled; those who had stayed were worse than destitute, there was nothing to take from them, and the soldiers, little given to pity, often even gave them the last food they had, instead of taking from them.

The Pavlogradsky regiment lost only two men wounded in action; but it lost nearly half of its men to famine and disease. In the hospitals death was such a certainty that soldiers sick with fever and bloated from bad food preferred to go on serving, forcing themselves to drag their feet to the front rather than go to the hospital. With the coming of spring, the soldiers began to find sprouting from the ground a plant resembling asparagus, which for some reason they called �Mashka�s sweet root,� and they scattered over the meadows and fields hunting for this Mashka�s sweet root (which was very bitter), digging it up with their sabers and eating it, in spite of orders not to eat this noxious plant. In spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers�a swelling of the hands, feet, and face, the cause of which the medics took to be the consuming of this root. But in spite of the prohibition, the Pavlogradsky soldiers of Denisov�s squadron mostly ate Mashka�s sweet root, because for two weeks already the last supply of biscuits had been stretched, each man receiving only half a pound per day, and the potatoes of the last shipment had frozen or sprouted.

It was also the second week that the horses had been eating straw from the roofs of houses; they were hideously skinny and still covered with their winter coat, which was matted in clumps.

Despite such destitution, the soldiers and officers lived just as always; now, too, though with pale and swollen faces and in tattered uniforms, the hussars lined up for roll call, did the cleaning, groomed the horses, polished their arms, pulled straw from the roofs to feed the horses, and sat down to eat around the cauldrons, going away hungry, joking about their vile food and their hunger. Just as always, in their time off from service, the soldiers made bonfires, steamed themselves naked by the flames, smoked, sorted and baked the sprouted, fusty potatoes, and told or listened to stories about Potemkin�s or Suvorov�s campaigns, or tales about Alyosha the Rogue and the priest�s farmhand Mikolka.

The officers, just as usual, lived two or three together in gaping, half-ravaged houses. The senior officers busied themselves with obtaining straw and potatoes, and the means of nourishing the men in general; the lower ranks were taken up, as always, some with cards (there was plenty of money, though no provisions), some with harmless games like horseshoes and ninepins. There was little talk about the general course of the war, partly because nothing positive was known, partly because it was vaguely felt that the general business of the war was going badly.

Rostov lived with Denisov, as before, and their bond of friendship had become still stronger since their time on leave. Denisov never spoke about Rostov�s family, but from the tender friendship which the commander showed his officer, Rostov felt that the elder hussar�s unlucky love for Natasha played a part in the strengthening of this friendship. Denisov clearly tried to expose Rostov to danger as rarely as possible, protected him, and met him with particular joy when he returned from action safe and sound. During one of his missions, in an abandoned, ravaged village, where he had gone for provisions, Rostov found a family made up of an old Pole, his daughter, and a nursing baby. They were poorly clothed, hungry, and could not leave, having no means of moving anywhere. Rostov brought them to the camp, placed them in his quarters, and kept them for several weeks, while the old man was recovering. One of Rostov�s comrades got to talking about women, and began to tease Rostov, saying he was the cleverest of them all, and that it would not be a bad thing if he introduced his comrades to the pretty Polish woman he had saved. Rostov took the joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasant things to the officer that Denisov barely managed to keep them from a duel. When the officer left and Denisov, who did not know himself what Rostov�s relations with the Polish woman were, began to rebuke him for being hot-tempered, Rostov said to him:

�Think what you will�She�s like a sister to me, and I can�t describe to you how hurt I felt�because�well, since I��

Denisov slapped him on the shoulder and quickly began pacing the room without looking at Rostov, something he did in moments of inner turmoil.

�It�s your crazy Rostov breed,� he said, and Rostov noticed tears in Denisov�s eyes.


XVI

In the month of April, the troops were enlivened by news that the sovereign was coming to the army. Rostov did not manage to get to the review that the sovereign held in Bartenstein: the Pavlogradsky regiment was stationed at outposts far forward of Bartenstein.

They were on bivouac. Denisov and Rostov lived in a dugout covered with branches and turf that the soldiers had made for them. The dugout was made in the following way, which had then come into fashion: a trench was dug four feet wide, five feet deep, and nine feet long. At one end of the dugout, steps were made, and this was the way down, the entrance; the trench itself was the room, in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board lying on four posts at the far end�this was a table. Along both sides of the trench, earth was removed to a width of two and a half feet, and this made two beds or couches. The roof was constructed in such a way that one could stand up in the middle, and one could even sit up on the beds if one moved closer to the table. Denisov, who lived in luxury, because the soldiers of his squadron loved him, also had a board in the pediment of the roof with a piece of broken but mended glass set into it. When it was very cold, hot coals from the soldiers� bonfires were brought to the steps (the anteroom, as Denisov called this part of the shed) on a bent piece of sheet iron, and it became so warm that the officers, of whom there were always many with Rostov and Denisov, sat in nothing but their shirts.

In the month of April, Rostov was on duty. Past seven in the morning, coming home after a sleepless night, he ordered hot coals brought, changed his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank some tea, got warm, tidied things up in his corner and on the table, and with a wind-burned face, in nothing but his shirt, lay on his back with his hands behind his head. He thought pleasantly about the promotion he was supposed to receive one of those days for his last reconnoitering, and waited for Denisov, who had stepped out somewhere. Rostov wanted to talk with him.

From behind the hut came the rolling shout of Denisov, obviously in a fit of temper. Rostov moved to the window to see whom he was dealing with, and saw Sergeant Major Topcheenko.

�I ordered you not to let them eat that root, Mashka�s or whatever!� shouted Denisov. �I saw it myself, Lazarchuk was bringing some from the fields.�

�I ordered them, Your Honor, they don�t obey,� said the sergeant major.

Rostov lay down again on his bed and thought with pleasure: �Let him fuss and bustle now, I�ve done my job and I�m lying down�that�s splendid!� Through the wall he heard that, besides the sergeant major, Lavrushka, Denisov�s pert and roguish lackey, was also talking. Lavrushka was telling something about some sort of wagons, biscuits, and oxen he had seen when he went for provisions.

From behind the shed came the shouting of Denisov again, moving away, and the words: �Saddle up�second section!�

�Where are they going?� Rostov wondered.

Five minutes later Denisov came into the shed, climbed onto the bed in his muddy boots, angrily smoked his pipe, scattered all his belongings around, strapped on his riding whip and saber, and started out of the dugout. To Rostov�s question, where to?�he answered angrily and vaguely that there was business to be done.

�Let God and the reat sovereign judge me for it!� Denisov said as he went out; and Rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splash through the mud behind the shed. Rostov did not even bother to find out where Denisov had gone. Having warmed up in his corner, he fell asleep and emerged from the hut only towards evening. Denisov had not come back yet. The evening turned clear; by the next dugout two officers and a junker were pitching horseshoes, laughing as the horseshoes stuck in the loose, muddy soil. Rostov joined them. In the middle of the game, the officers saw some wagons driving up to them. They were followed by about fifteen hussars on skinny horses. The wagons with their hussar convoy drove up to the tethering posts, and a crowd of hussars surrounded them.

�Well, so Denisov got all upset,� said Rostov, �and here come the provisions.�

�Right you are!� said the officers. �The soldiers must be overjoyed!� Denisov rode a little behind the hussars, accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking about something. Rostov walked towards them.

�I warn you, Captain,� said one of the officers, thin, small, and clearly very angry.

�I said I won�t give them up,� replied Denisov.

�You�ll answer for this, Captain, it�s violence�to seize your own army�s transport! Our men haven�t eaten for two days!�

�And mine haven�t eaten for two weeks,� replied Denisov.

�It�s highway robbery, my dear sir, you�ll answer for it!� the infantry officer repeated, raising his voice.

�What are you bothering me for? Eh?� shouted Denisov, suddenly flaring up. �I�m the one who�ll answer for it, not you, so stop buzzing around here while you�re still in one piece. March!� he shouted at the officers.

�All right, then!� shouted the little officer, not intimidated and not going away. �This is highway robbery, so I�ll��

�March off to the devil, quick step, while you�re still in one piece.� And Denisov turned his horse towards the officer.

�All right, all right,� the officer said menacingly, and, turning his horse, he rode off at a trot, bouncing in the saddle.

�A dog on a fence, a real live dog on a fence,� Denisov said behind him, a cavalryman�s highest mockery of an infantryman on horseback, and riding up to Rostov, he burst out laughing.

�I took it from the infantry, took the whole transport by force!� he said. �What, should people drop dead of hunger?�

The wagons that were driven up to the hussars had been intended for an infantry regiment, but learning from Lavrushka that the transport was unescorted, Denisov and his hussars took it by force. The soldiers were given biscuits in plenty, and they even shared them with other squadrons.

The next day the regimental commander summoned Denisov and told him, covering his eyes with his spread fingers: �I look at it this way, I know nothing, and will not start proceedings; but I advise you to go to the staff and settle matters there in the provisions department, and, if possible, to sign a receipt that you received such-and-such provisions; in the contrary case�since the request was put in by the infantry regiment�proceedings could be started and might end badly.�

Denisov rode to the staff straight from the regimental commander, with a sincere wish to follow his advice. In the evening he returned to his dugout in such a state as Rostov had never yet seen him in. Denisov could not speak and was gasping for breath. When Rostov asked what was the matter with him, he only uttered incomprehensible oaths and threats in a hoarse and weak voice.

Alarmed by Denisov�s state, Rostov suggested he should undress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.

�Me tried for robbery�ach! Give me more water�let them try me, but I�ll beat the scoundrels, I�ll always beat them, and I�ll tell the sovereign. Give me ice,� he kept murmuring.

The regimental doctor came and said it was necessary to bleed him. A deep dish of dark blood came from Denisov�s shaggy arm, and only then was he able to tell what had happened to him.

�I arrive,� Denisov told them. ��Well, where�s your superior here?� They point. �Kindly wait.� �I have duties, I�ve ridden twenty miles, I have no time to wait, announce me.� Very good, this super-thief comes out and starts teaching me. �This is robbery!� �Robbery,� I say, �is not when somebody takes pgrrovisions to feed his soldiers, but when he takes them so as to line his pockets!� Very good. �Give your signature to the commissioner,� he says, �and your case will be passed on through the chain of command.� I go to the commissioner. I enter�at the table sits�who do you think?! No, just think!�Who is it that�s starving us?� Denisov shouted, pounding the table with the fist of his just-bled arm so hard that the table almost fell and the glasses on it jumped. �Telyanin!! �So it�s you who are starving us to death?!� One-two in the mug, they landed nicely��Ah!�you this, this, this, and that�� and I started pummeling him! Anyhow it was good fun, I can tell you,� Denisov cried, baring his white teeth gleefully and spitefully under his black mustache. �I�d have killed him if they hadn�t pulled us apart.�

�But what are you shouting for? Calm down,� said Rostov. �Here you�re bleeding again. Wait, your bandage should be changed.�

Denisov�s bandage was changed, and he was put to bed. The next day he woke up cheerful and calm.

But at noon the regimental adjutant came with a grave and mournful face to Denisov and Rostov�s dugout and regretfully showed them an official paper to Major Denisov from the regimental commander, in which questions were raised about yesterday�s occurrence. The adjutant informed them that the affair was bound to take a rather bad turn, that a court-martial had been appointed, and that, considering the present strictness about marauding and insubordination among the troops, in the best case the affair might end in demotion.

The affair was presented by the offended side in such guise that, after seizing the transport, Major Denisov, uninvited, in a drunken state, appeared at the quartermaster general�s, called him a thief, threatened him with a beating, and, when removed, rushed into the office, attacked two clerks, and dislocated the arm of one.

To Rostov�s renewed questions, Denisov, laughing, said that it seemed somebody else had turned up there, but it was all nonsense, trifles, that he did not even dream of being afraid of any courts, and that if those scoundrels dared to provoke him, he would give them an answer they would remember.

Denisov spoke disdainfully of the whole affair; but Rostov knew him too well not to notice that, in his soul (concealing it from others), he was afraid of the trial and suffered over the affair, which was obviously going to have bad consequences. Every day papers of inquiry came, summonses from the court, and on the first of May, Denisov was ordered to turn over command of the squadron to the next in seniority and report to the division staff for explanations of the case of violence in the provisions commission. On the eve of that day, Platov made a reconnaissance of the enemy with two Cossack regiments and two hussar squadrons. Denisov, as always, rode out in front of the line, showing off his courage. A bullet fired by a French rifleman hit him in the fleshy upper part of the leg. Perhaps at another time Denisov would not have left the regiment with such a slight wound, but now he took advantage of this chance, excused himself from appearing at the division, and went to the hospital.


XVII

In the month of June, the battle of Friedland took place, in which the Pavlogradsky regiment did not participate, and after it a truce was declared. Rostov, who painfully felt his friend�s absence, having no news of him since the time of his departure and worried about the course of his case and his wound, took advantage of the truce and obtained permission to visit Denisov in the hospital.

The hospital was in a little Prussian village twice ravaged by Russian and French troops. Precisely because it was summer, when it was so pleasant in the fields, this little village, with its broken roofs and fences and its littered streets, with ragged inhabitants and drunken or sick soldiers wandering about in it, presented an especially dismal sight.

The hospital was housed in a stone buidling with a portion of its windows and window frames broken, which stood in a yard with the remains of a dismantled fence. Several soldiers, bandaged, pale, and swollen, were walking about or sitting in the yard in the sun.

As soon as Rostov went through the door of the house, he was enveloped by the stench of rotting flesh and hospital. On the stairs he met a Russian military doctor with a cigar in his mouth. The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.

�I can�t tear myself in two,� said the doctor. �Come to Makar Alexeevich�s in the evening, I�ll be there.� The assistant asked him about something else.

�Eh! do it your own way! Isn�t it all the same?� The doctor saw Rostov coming up the stairs.

�What do you want here, Your Honor?� asked the doctor. �What do you want here? The bullet missed you, so you want to catch typhus? This is a pest-house, old boy.�

�How so?� asked Rostov.

�Typhus, my lad. Anyone who comes here is a dead man. There�s only the two of us, me and Makeev� (he pointed to the assistant) �still hanging on here. Five of our fellow doctors have already died. A new one comes, after one little week he�s finished,� the doctor said with visible pleasure. �Prussian doctors were invited, but our allies don�t find it to their liking.�

Rostov explained to him that he would like to see the hussar major Denisov, who was a patient there.

�I don�t know, I can�t say, my lad. Just think, I�ve got three hospitals to myself, four hundred and some patients! It�s a good thing some Prussian charitable ladies send us two pounds of coffee and lint a month, otherwise we�d have perished.� He laughed. �Four hundred, my lad, and they keep sending new ones. It is four hundred? Eh?� he turned to the assistant.

The assistant looked exhausted. He was clearly waiting with vexation for the garrulous doctor to leave.

�Major Denisov,� Rostov repeated, �he was wounded at Moliten.�

�Seems he died. Eh, Makeev?� the doctor asked the assistant indifferently.

The assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor�s words.

�What, a tall man, with reddish hair?� asked the doctor.

Rostov described Denisov�s appearance.

�There was one, there was one like that,� the doctor said as if joyfully. �Must have died, but anyhow I�ll check, I had lists. Do you have them, Makeev?�

�Makar Alexeich has the lists,� said the assistant. �But if you�d be pleased to go to the officers� ward, you can see for yourself there,� he added, turning to Rostov.

�Eh, you�d better not, my lad,� said the doctor, �or you may wind up staying yourself!� But Rostov took leave of the doctor and asked the assistant to accompany him.

�Just don�t go blaming me!� the doctor shouted from the bottom of the stairs.

Rostov and the assistant went into the corridor. The hospital stench in this dark corridor was so strong that Rostov held his hand to his nose and had to stop and gather his strength to go further. A door to the right opened, and a thin, yellow man on crutches stuck himself out, barefoot and in nothing but his underwear. Leaning against the door frame, he looked at the passing men with glittering, envious eyes. Glancing through the door, Rostov saw sick and wounded men lying there on the floor, on straw and overcoats.

�What�s this?� he asked.

�The soldiers� wards,� the assistant replied. �Nothing to be done,� he added, as if apologizing.

�May I go in and look?� asked Rostov.

�What�s there to look at?� said the assistant. But precisely because the assistant obviously did not want to let him go in, Rostov entered the soldiers� wards. Here the stench, which he had managed to get used to in the corridor, was still stronger. The stench here was slightly different: it was sharper, and one could sense that it was coming precisely from here.

In the long room, brightly lit by the sun through the large windows, sick and wounded men lay in two rows, their heads towards the walls, leaving a passage in the middle. Most of them were oblivious and paid no attention to the visitors. Those who were conscious all sat up or raised their thin, yellow faces, and fastened their eyes on Rostov with the same expression of hope for help, of reproach and envy of another man�s health. Rostov went to the middle of the room, glanced into the next two rooms through the open doors, and on both sides saw the same thing. He stopped, silently looking around him. He had never expected to see what he saw. Right in front of him, almost across the middle passage, on the bare floor lay a sick man, probably a Cossack, because his hair was cut square. This Cossack lay on his back, his huge arms and legs spread. His face was purple-red, his eyes were completely rolled up so that only the whites showed, and the veins on his bare feet and arms, also red, were taut as ropes. He struck his head on the floor and said something hoarsely, and started repeating a word. Rostov listened to what he said and figured out the word he was repeating. This word was �drink, drink, drink!� Rostov looked around, hoping to find someone who could put this patient in his place and give him some water.

�Who looks after the patients here?� he asked the assistant. Just then a commissariat soldier, a hospital attendant, came out of the next room and, stamping his feet, snapped to attention in front of Rostov.

�Good day to you, Your Honor, sir!� the soldier shouted out, rolling his eyes at Rostov and obviously taking him for a hospital superior.

�Take him away, give him water,� Rostov said, pointing to the Cossack.

�Yes, sir, Your Honor,� the soldier said with pleasure, rolling his eyes and drawing himself up still more zealously, but not budging from his place.

�No, there�s nothing to be done here,� thought Rostov, lowering his eyes, and he was already about to leave, but he felt a meaningful gaze directed at him from the right and turned to look. Almost in the corner, on an overcoat, sat an old soldier with a yellow, stern face, gaunt as a skeleton�s, and an unshaven gray beard, looking fixedly at Rostov. The old soldier�s neighbor on one side was whispering something to him, pointing at Rostov. Rostov understood that the old man meant to ask him something. He went closer and saw that only one of the old man�s legs was bent under him; the other was missing above the knee. The old man�s other neighbor, who lay without moving, his head thrown back, some distance from him, was a young soldier with a waxen pallor on his snub-nosed, still freckled face, and only the whites of his eyes showing. Rostov looked at this snub-nosed soldier and a chill ran down his spine.

�But this one seems to be�� he turned to the assistant.

�We�ve been asking and asking, Your Honor,� said the old soldier, his lower jaw trembling. �He passed away this morning. We�re people, too, not dogs��

�I�ll send someone at once, he�ll be taken away, he�ll be taken away,� the assistant said hastily. �If you please, Your Honor.�

�Let�s go, let�s go!� Rostov said hastily, and, lowering his eyes and shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed through the line of those reproachful and envious eyes directed at him as he left the room.


XVIII

Going down the corridor, the assistant led Rostov to the officers� wards, which consisted of three rooms with open doors. In these rooms there were beds; wounded and sick officers were sitting and lying on them. Some walked about the room in hospital gowns. The first person Rostov met in the officers� ward was a small, thin man without an arm, in a nightcap and hospital gown, with a little pipe in his teeth, who was walking about the first room. Rostov peered at him intently, trying to remember where he had seen him.

�See where God granted us to meet again,� said the small man. �Tushin, Tushin�remember, I gave you a ride at Sch&#246;ngraben? I�ve had a bit cut off, see�� he said, smiling and showing the empty sleeve of the robe. �It�s Vassily Dmitrich Denisov you�re looking for? He�s my roommate,� he said, on learning who Rostov wanted. �This way, this way.� And Tushin led him to the other room, from which came the loud laughter of several voices.

�How can they not only live here, but even laugh?� thought Rostov, still sensing that smell of dead flesh he had picked up in the soldiers� section, and still seeing around him those envious looks that had followed after him on both sides and the face of the young soldier with rolled-up eyes.

Denisov, the blanket pulled over his head, was asleep in bed, though it was nearly noon.

�Ah! Rostov! Greetings, greetings!� he shouted, in the same voice he used in the regiment; but Rostov noticed sadly that, behind this habitual casualness and liveliness, some new, bad, hidden feeling showed in the expression of Denisov�s face, in his intonations and words.

His wound, despite its insignificance, still had not healed, though it was now six weeks since he was wounded. His face had the same pale swollenness of all the hospital faces. But it was not this that struck Rostov: what struck him was that Denisov did not seem glad to see him and smiled at him unnaturally. Denisov did not ask about the regiment, nor about the general course of affairs. When Rostov mentioned it, Denisov did not listen.

Rostov even noticed that Denisov found it unpleasant to be reminded of the regiment and generally of that other, free life that went on outside the hospital. It seemed he was trying to forget that former life and was interested only in his case with the provision officials. To Rostov�s question about how the case stood, he immediately pulled from under the pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the draft of his reply to it. When he started reading his paper, he became animated and particularly drew Rostov�s attention to the biting remarks in it directed at his enemies. Denisov�s hospital friends, who surrounded Rostov as a newly arrived person from the free world, gradually began to disperse as soon as Denisov started reading his paper. From their faces, Rostov understood that these gentlemen had all heard the story more than once already and were tired of it. Only the man in the next bed, a fat uhlan, stayed sitting on his cot, frowning gloomily and smoking his pipe, and little one-armed Tushin went on listening, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the reading, the uhlan interrupted Denisov.

�In my view,� he said, turning to Rostov, �he ought simply to beg the sovereign for mercy. They say there will be lots of rewards now, and surely he�d be forgiven��

�Me beg the sovereign!� Denisov said in a voice which he wanted to endow with its former energy and ardor, but which rang with futile irritability. �For what? If I were a robber, I�d ask for mercy, but I�m on trial because I brought the robbers to light. Let them take me to court, I�m not afraid of anybody; I�ve served the tsar and the fatherland honorably, and didn�t steal! To demote me and�Listen, I just write to them straight out, here�s what I write: �If I were an embezzler���

�It�s cleverly written, there�s no saying it�s not,� said Tushin. �But that�s not the point, Vassily Dmitrich,� he also turned to Rostov, �a man ought to submit, but Vassily Dmitrich here doesn�t want to. The auditor told you your case was going badly.�

�Well, let it go badly,� said Denisov.

�The auditor wrote a petition for you,� Tushin went on, �and you ought to sign it, and, see, you can send it with him� (he pointed to Rostov). �He�s surely got a hand in at the staff. There couldn�t be a better chance.�

�Yes, but I told you I won�t go roveling,� Denisov interrupted and continued reading the letter.

Rostov did not dare to persuade Denisov, though he felt instinctively that the way suggested by Tushin and the other officers was the surest, and though he would have considered himself very happy if he could have been of help to Denisov: he knew Denisov�s inflexible will and righteous ardor.

When the reading of Denisov�s venomous papers, which lasted more than an hour, was over, Rostov said nothing and spent the rest of the day in a very sad state of mind, in the company of Denisov�s hospital friends, who again gathered around him. He told them things he knew and listened to what others had to say. Denisov was gloomily silent throughout the evening.

Late in the evening, Rostov got ready to go and asked Denisov whether there would be any errands.

�Yes, wait,� said Denisov, glancing at the officers, and, taking his papers from under the pillow, he went to the window, where there was an inkstand, and sat down to write.

�It seems you can�t break an axhead with a straw,� he said, coming from the window and handing Rostov a large envelope. This was a petition addressed to the sovereign, drawn up by the auditor, in which Denisov, without mentioning anything about the failures of the provisions department, merely begged for mercy.

�Hand it in, since it seems�� He did not finish and smiled a painfully false smile.


XIX

Having returned to the regiment and told the commander about the state of Denisov�s case, Rostov rode on to Tilsit with the letter to the sovereign.

On the thirteenth of June, the French and Russian emperors met at Tilsit. Boris Drubetskoy asked the important person to whom he was attached that he be included in the suite appointed to be stationed in Tilsit.

�Je voudrais voir le grand homme,� he said, referring to Napoleon, whom, until then, like everyone else, he had always called Buonaparte.

�Vous parlez de Buonaparte?� his general said to him, smiling.

Boris looked questioningly at his general and understood at once that this was a joking test.

�Mon prince, je parle de l�empereur Napol&#233;on,� he replied. The general smiled and patted him on the shoulder.

�You�ll go far,� he said to him, and took him along.

Boris was among the few who were at the Niemen on the day of the emperors� meeting; he saw the rafts with monograms and Napoleon riding along the other bank past the French guards; saw the emperor Alexander�s pensive face as he sat silently in a tavern on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleon�s arrival; saw how both emperors got into boats and how Napoleon, who was the first to reach the raft, stepped forward quickly to meet Alexander and gave him his hand, and how the two disappeared into the pavilion. Since the time of his entrance into the higher world, Boris had made it his habit to observe attentively what was happening around him and to write it down. During the meeting in Tilsit, he asked the names of the persons who arrived with Napoleon, about the uniforms they were wearing, and listened attentively to the words spoken by important persons. At the moment when the emperors went into the pavilion, he looked at his watch, and he did not forget to look again when Alexander came out of the pavilion. The meeting had lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes; and he wrote it down that evening, among other facts which he supposed were of historic significance. Since the emperor�s suite was very small, for a man who valued his success in the service to be in Tilsit at the time of the emperors� meeting was a very important matter, and Boris, having gone to Tilsit, felt that from then on his position was completely assured. He was not only known, he was an accustomed and familiar figure. Twice he had been entrusted with messages to the sovereign himself, so that the sovereign knew his face, and all his attendants were now not only not aloof, as before, considering him a new person, but would have been surprised if he were not there.

Boris roomed with another adjutant, the Polish count Zhilinsky. Zhilinsky, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, passionately loved the French, and almost every day during their stay in Tilsit, Zhilinsky and Boris gathered French officers from the guards and French headquarters for dinners and lunches.

In the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhilinsky, Boris�s roommate, gave a supper for his French acquaintances. At this supper there was a guest of honor�one of Napoleon�s adjutants�as well as several officers of the French guards, and a young boy from an old French aristocratic family, Napoleon�s page. On that same day, Rostov, taking advantage of the darkness so as not to be recognized, in civilian dress, arrived in Tilsit and went to the apartment of Zhilinsky and Boris.

In Rostov, as in the whole army from which he came, that change in relations with Napoleon and the French, turning them from enemies into friends, was still far from being accomplished as it had been at headquarters and in Boris. In the army they still went on experiencing a mixed feeling of anger, contempt, and fear for Bonaparte and the French. Still recently Rostov, talking with one of Platov�s Cossack officers, had argued that if Napoleon were ever taken prisoner, he would be treated not as a sovereign, but as a criminal. Still recently, meeting a wounded French colonel on the road, Rostov had become heated, proving to him that there could be no peace between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte. Therefore Rostov was oddly struck in Boris�s apartment by the sight of French officers in those same uniforms which he was used to looking at quite differently from the flank line. As soon as he saw a French officer thrust himself out of the door, that warlike, hostile feeling which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly took hold of him. He stopped on the threshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetskoy lived there. Boris, hearing a stranger�s voice in the front hall, came out to meet him. His face, when he recognized Rostov, at first expressed annoyance.

�Ah, it�s you, very glad, very glad to see you,� he said anyhow, smiling and going up to him. But Rostov had noticed his first reaction.

�It seems I chose the wrong time,� he said. �I wouldn�t have come, but I�m on business,� he said coldly�

�No, I was only surprised that you�ve left the regiment. Dans un moment je suis &#224; vous,� he replied to a voice that was calling him.

�I can see it�s the wrong time,� Rostov repeated.

The expression of annoyance had already disappeared from Boris�s face; evidently having reflected and decided what to do, he took him by both hands with a particular calm and led him to the neighboring room. Boris�s eyes, looking calmly and firmly at Rostov, were as if veiled by something, as if some sort of screen�the blue spectacles of convention�had been put on them. So it seemed to Rostov.

�Ah, enough, please, as if you could come at the wrong time,� said Boris. He led him into the room, where the supper table had been laid, introduced him to his guests, giving his name and explaining that he was not a civilian, but a hussar officer and his old friend. �Count Zhilinsky, le comte N. N., le capitaine S. S.,� he named his guests. Rostov looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, made his bows reluctantly, and said nothing.

Zhilinsky clearly took this new Russian person into his circle without any joy and said nothing to Rostov. Boris seemed not to notice the constraint caused by the appearance of a new person and, with the same agreeable calm and veiling of the eyes with which he had met Rostov, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the Frenchmen turned with habitual French politeness to the stubbornly silent Rostov and said to him that he had probably come to Tilsit to see the emperor.

�No, I�m on business,� Rostov answered curtly.

Rostov felt ill-humored immediately after he noticed the displeasure on Boris�s face, and, as always happens with people who are ill-humored, it seemed to him that everyone was looking at him hostilely and that he was hampering them all. And indeed he was hampering them all and alone remained outside the newly initiated general conversation. �Why is he sitting here?� said the glances cast at him by the guests. He got up and went over to Boris.

�Anyhow I�m in your way,� he said softly to him. �Let�s go and talk business, and I�ll leave.�

�Why no, not in the least,� said Boris. �But if you�re tired, let�s go to my room, and you can lie down to rest.�

�Yes, in fact��

They went into the small room where Boris slept. Rostov, not sitting down, at once, with irritation�as if Boris was guilty before him for something�began telling him about Denisov�s case, asking whether he could and would intercede for Denisov with the sovereign through his general and deliver his letter through him. When they were alone, Rostov realized for the first time that it was awkward for him to look Boris in the eye. Boris, crossing his legs, and stroking the slender fingers of his right hand with his left, listened to Rostov the way a general listens to the report of a subordinate, now looking away, now looking directly into Rostov�s eyes with the same veiled gaze. Each time that happened, Rostov felt awkward and lowered his eyes.

�I�ve heard about cases of that sort, and I know that the sovereign is very severe on such occasions. I think it should not get as far as his majesty. In my opinion, it would be better to ask the corps commander directly�But generally I think��

�If you don�t want to do anything, just say so!� Rostov nearly shouted, not looking into Boris�s eyes.

Boris smiled.

�On the contrary, I�ll do what I can, only I thought��

Just then Zhilinsky�s voice was heard at the door, calling Boris.

�Well, go, go,� said Rostov, and, declining supper and remaining alone in the little room, he paced up and down for a long time and listened to the merry French talk in the next room.


XX

Rostov had come to Tilsit on the day least suitable of all for interceding on Denisov�s behalf. He could not go to the general on duty himself, because he was wearing a tailcoat and had come to Tilsit without permission of the authorities, while Boris, even if he wanted to, could not do it on the day after Rostov�s arrival. On that day, the twenty-seventh of June, the preliminary conditions for peace were signed. The emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander received the Legion of Honor, and Napoleon the St. Andrew of the first degree, and on that day a dinner was arranged for the Preobrazhensky battalion, given by the battalion of the French guards. Both sovereigns were to be present at this banquet.

For Rostov it was so awkward and unpleasant to be with Boris that, when Boris looked in on him after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and the next day he left the house early in the morning, trying not to see him. Nikolai wandered around town in a tailcoat and a round hat, gazing at the French and their uniforms, and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French emperors lived. In the square he saw tables being set up and preparations being made for the dinner; in the streets he saw draperies hung across with flags in the Russian and French colors and huge monograms of A and N. In the windows of the houses there were also flags and monograms.

�Boris doesn�t want to help me, and I don�t want to turn to him. That�s settled,� thought Nikolai, �it�s all over between us, but I won�t leave here without doing all I can for Denisov and, above all, without delivering the letter to the sovereign. To the sovereign?! He�s here!� thought Rostov, involuntarily coming up again to the house occupied by Alexander.

Saddle horses stood by this house, and the suite was gathering, evidently preparing for the sovereign�s levee.

�I may see him any moment,� thought Rostov. �If only I could deliver the letter to him directly and tell him everything�Would they really arrest me for my tailcoat? It can�t be! He would understand whose side justice is on. He understands everything, knows everything. Who can be more just and magnanimous than he? Well, and if they arrest me for being here, what�s so bad about that?� he thought, looking at an officer going into the house occupied by the sovereign. �People do go in. Eh! it�s all nonsense! I�ll go and deliver the letter to the sovereign myself: so much the worse for Drubetskoy, who drove me to it.� And suddenly, with a resoluteness which he did not expect of himself, Rostov felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house occupied by the sovereign.

�No, I�m not going to let the chance slip now as I did after Austerlitz,� he thought, expecting to meet the sovereign any moment and feeling the blood rush to his heart at the thought of it. �I�ll fall at his feet and plead with him. He�ll raise me up, listen to me, and even thank me. �I�m happy when I can do good, but to set right an injustice is the greatest happiness,�� Rostov imagined the words that the sovereign would say to him. And he walked past curious onlookers up the porch of the house which the sovereign occupied.

From the porch a broad stairway led straight up; to the right he saw a closed door. Under the stairway was the door leading to the ground floor.

�Whom do you want?� someone asked.

�To deliver a letter, a petition to his majesty,� Nikolai said in a trembling voice.

�A petition�go to the officer on duty, this way, please� (he pointed him to the downstairs door). �Only you won�t be received.�

Hearing this indifferent voice, Rostov became frightened of what he was doing; the thought of meeting the sovereign at any moment was so seductive and therefore so frightening for him that he was ready to flee, but an attendant, meeting him, opened the door of the officer on duty, and Rostov went in.

A short, stout man of about thirty, in white trousers, top boots, and nothing but an evidently just-put-on cambric shirt, was standing in this room; a valet behind him was buttoning on a pair of splendid new silk-embroidered suspenders, which Rostov noticed for some reason. This man was talking to someone in the next room.

�Bien faite et la beaut&#233; du diable,� this man was saying, and, seeing Rostov, he stopped speaking and frowned.

�What can I do for you? A petition?��

�Qu�est-ce que c�est?� asked someone from the other room.

�Encore un petitionnaire,� replied the man in suspenders.

�Later, tell him. He�ll be coming out in a minute, we have to go.�

�Later, later, tomorrow. There�s no time��

Rostov turned and was about to leave, but the man in suspenders stopped him.

�Who sent you? Who are you?�

�From Major Denisov,� Rostov replied.

�Who are you? An officer?�

�Lieutenant Count Rostov.

�What boldness! Appeal through the chain of command. And take yourself away, away!�� And he began getting into the tunic that the valet was holding for him.

Rostov went to the front hall again and noticed that there were already many officers and generals in full-dress uniform past whom he would have to walk.

Cursing his boldness, his heart sinking at the thought that he could meet the sovereign at any moment, be disgraced before him and put under arrest, fully understanding all the inappropriateness of his behavior and regretting it, Rostov, with lowered eyes, was making his way out of the house, surrounded by the crowd of the brilliant suite, when someone�s familiar voice called him and someone�s hand stopped him.

�What are you doing here in a tailcoat, my lad?� the bass voice asked him.

It was a cavalry general who had earned special favor from the sovereign during this campaign, the former commander of the division in which Rostov served.

Rostov fearfully began to justify himself, but seeing the general�s good-naturedly joking face, led him aside and in an agitated voice told him the whole affair, begging the general to intercede for Denisov, whom he knew. The general listened to Rostov, shaking his head gravely.

�A pity, a pity for the fine fellow; give me the letter.�

Rostov barely had time to hand him the letter and tell him all about Denisov�s case before the sound of quick footsteps with spurs was heard from the stairway, and the general, leaving him, moved towards the porch. The gentlemen of the sovereign�s suite ran down the steps and went to their horses. The groom Hayne, the same one who had been at Austerlitz, led up the sovereign�s horse, and from the stairs came a light creak of footsteps which Rostov knew at once. Forgetting the danger of being recognized, Rostov, with some curious townsfolk, moved close to the porch and again, after two years, saw the same adored features, the same face, the same gaze, the same gait, the same combination of majesty and mildness�And the feeling of rapture and love for the sovereign rose again with its old force in Rostov�s soul. The sovereign, in the Preobrazhensky tunic, white buckskin breeches, and high top boots, with a star Rostov did not know (it was the L&#233;gion d�honneur), came out to the porch, holding his hat under his arm and putting on a glove. He stopped, looked about, and illuminated everything around him with his gaze. He spoke a few words to one of the generals. He also recognized the former commander of Rostov�s division, smiled to him, and called him over.

The entire suite now drew back, and Rostov saw the general speak about something with the sovereign for a rather long time.

The sovereign said a few words to him and took a step towards his horse. Again the crowd of the suite and the crowd of the street, in which Rostov stood, moved towards the sovereign. Stopping by his horse and placing his hand on the saddle, the sovereign turned to the cavalry general and spoke in a loud voice, obviously wishing everyone to hear him.

�I cannot, General, and the reason why I cannot is that the law is stronger than I,� said the sovereign, and he raised his foot to the stirrup. The general inclined his head deferentially, the sovereign mounted and rode down the street at a gallop. Rostov, beside himself with rapture, ran after him with the crowd.


XXI

On the square to which the sovereign was riding there stood facing each other on the right the Preobrazhensky battalion and on the left the battalion of the French guards in their bearskin hats.

As the sovereign was approaching one flank of the battalions, which presented arms, another group of horsemen was riding up to the opposite flank, and at the head of them Rostov recognized Napoleon. It could not have been anyone else. He rode at a gallop, in a small hat, with the sash of St. Andrew across his shoulder, in a blue tunic unbuttoned over a white camisole, on an extraordinary purebred gray Arabian stallion, on a gold-embroidered crimson shabrack. Riding up to Alexander, he raised his hat, and as he did so Rostov�s cavalry eye could not help noticing that Napoleon sat his horse poorly and unsteadily. The battalions shouted �Hurrah!� and �Vive l�Empereur!� Napoleon said something to Alexander. The two emperors got off their horses and took each other�s hands. Napoleon�s face wore an unpleasantly false smile. Alexander was saying something to him with a benign expression.

Rostov, not taking his eyes away, despite the trampling of the French gendarmes� horses, attempting to move the crowd back, followed every movement of the emperor Alexander and Bonaparte. He was struck, as if it was unexpected, by the fact that Alexander behaved as an equal with Bonaparte, and that Bonaparte, quite freely, as if such closeness to the sovereign was natural and habitual to him, treated the Russian tsar as an equal.

Alexander and Napoleon, with the long tail of their suite, approached the right flank of the Preobrazhensky battalion, riding straight at the crowd that was standing there. The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the emperors that Rostov, who was standing in the first rows, was afraid he would be recognized.

�Sire, je vous demande la permission de donner la L&#233;gion d�honneur au plus brave de vos soldats,� said a sharp, precise voice, articulating every letter.

This was spoken by the short Bonaparte, looking from below straight into Alexander�s eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and, inclining his head, smiled pleasantly.

�&#192; celui qui s�est le plus vaillamment conduit dans cette derni&#232;re guerre,� Napoleon added, rapping out every syllable with a calm and assurance that Rostov found outrageous, and looking over the ranks of Russian soldiers standing at attention before him, still presenting arms and looking fixedly at the face of their emperor.

�Votre Majest&#233; me permettra-t-elle de demander l�avis du colonel,� said Alexander, and took a few hasty steps towards Prince Kozlovsky, the commander of the battalion. Bonaparte meanwhile began to remove the glove from his small white hand, tore it, and threw it down. An adjutant, hastily rushing forward from behind, picked it up.

�To whom should it be given?� the emperor Alexander said softly to Kozlovsky in Russian.

�To whomever you order, Your Majesty.�

The sovereign winced with displeasure and, looking around, said:

�But I must give him an answer.�

Kozlovsky, with a resolute air, looked over the ranks and in that look took in Rostov.

�What if it�s me?� thought Rostov.

�Lazarev!� the colonel commanded, frowning, and Lazarev, the first soldier in the rank, briskly stepped forward.

�Where are you going? Stop right there!� voices whispered to Lazarev, who did not know where to go. Lazarev stopped, casting a fearful sidelong glance at the colonel, and his face twitched, as happens with soldiers called out of line.

Napoleon turned his head slightly and held out his small, plump hand behind him, as if wishing to take something. The persons of his suite, guessing that very second what was wanted, began fussing, whispering, handing something on, and the page, the same one Rostov had seen the day before at Boris�s, ran forward and, bending deferentially over the proffered hand, and without making it wait a single second, placed in it the decoration on its red ribbon. Napoleon, not looking, closed two fingers. The decoration was between them. Napoleon went up to Lazarev, who, staring wide-eyed, stubbornly went on looking only at his sovereign, and gave the emperor Alexander a glance, showing thereby that what he was now doing, he was doing for his ally. The small white hand with the decoration touched the soldier Lazarev�s button. It was as if Napoleon knew that, for this soldier to be happy, rewarded, and distinguished from everyone else in the world, it was only necessary that his, Napoleon�s, hand deign to touch the soldier�s breast. Napoleon merely laid the cross on Lazarev�s breast and, lowering his hand, turned to Alexander, as if he knew that the cross must stick to Lazarev�s breast. The cross did stick, because obliging Russian and French hands instantly picked it up and fastened it to the tunic. Lazarev glanced darkly at the little man with white hands who had done something to him, and, motionless, continuing to present arms, again began gazing straight into Alexander�s eyes, as if asking Alexander if he should go on standing there or would now be ordered to take a few steps or perhaps to do something else. But he was not ordered to do anything, and he remained in that motionless state for a rather long time.

The sovereigns got on their horses and left. The Preobrazhensky battalion, breaking ranks, mingled with the French guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them.

Lazarev sat in the place of honor; he was embraced, congratulated, his hands were shaken by Russian and French officers. Crowds of officers and people came merely to look at Lazarev. A droning of Russian and French talk and laughter hung over the tables on the square. Two officers with flushed faces, merry and happy, walked past him.

�What a treat, brother�all on silver,� said one. �Have you seen Lazarev?�

�Yes.�

�Tomorrow, they say, the Preobrazhensky battalion will be the hosts.�

�No, but what luck for Lazarev! A twelve-hundred-franc pension for life.�

�How�s that for a hat, boys!� cried a Preobrazhensky soldier, putting on a Frenchman�s shaggy hat.

�Charming, suits you perfectly!�

�Did you hear the passwords?� one officer of the guards said to another. �Two days ago they were �Napol&#233;on, France, bravoure,� yesterday �Alexandre, Russie, grandeur� one day our sovereign gives the passwords, the next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our sovereign will send a St. George to the bravest of the French guards. No way out of it! He has to respond in kind.�

Boris, with his comrade Zhilinsky, also came to look at the Preobrazhensky banquet. On his way home, Boris noticed Rostov standing by the corner of a house.

�Rostov! Greetings! We haven�t seen each other,� he said and could not help asking what had happened to him: so strangely dark and upset was Rostov�s face.

�Never mind, never mind,� replied Rostov.

�Will you stop by?�

�Yes.�

Rostov stood at the corner for a long time, looking at the feasting men from a distance. Painful work was going on in his mind, which he could not bring to an end. Terrible doubts arose in his soul. Now he remembered Denisov with his changed expression, his submission, and the whole hospital with those torn-off arms and legs, that filth and disease. He imagined so vividly now that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked around to see where the stench could be coming from. Then he remembered that self-satisfied Bonaparte with his white little hand, who was now an emperor, whom the emperor Alexander liked and respected. Why, then, those torn-off arms and legs, those dead people? Then he remembered the rewarded Lazarev and Denisov punished and unforgiven. He caught himself in such strange thoughts that it made him frightened.

The smell of the Preobrazhenskys� food and his own hunger brought him out of that state: he had to eat something before he left. He went to the inn he had noticed in the morning. In the inn he found so many people and officers who had come, as he had, in civilian dress, that he had a hard time getting dinner. Two officers of his division joined him. The conversation naturally turned to the peace. The officers, Rostov�s comrades, like the greater part of the army, were displeased with the peace concluded after Friedland. They said that if we had held out a little longer, Napoleon would have been done for, that there were no biscuits or shot left in his army. Nikolai ate silently and mostly drank. He drank two bottles of wine by himself. The inner work that had arisen in him, not being resolved, still pained him. He was afraid to give himself to his thoughts and yet could not get rid of them. Suddenly, to the words of one of the officers, that it was offensive to look at the French, Rostov began shouting with a vehemence that was in no way justified and therefore surprised the officers very much.

�And how can you judge what would have been better!� he shouted, his face suddenly suffused with blood. �How can you judge the sovereign�s actions, what right have we to discuss it?! We can understand neither the goals nor the actions of the sovereign!�

�But I didn�t say a word about the sovereign,� the officer defended himself, unable to explain Rostov�s outburst otherwise than by his being drunk.

But Rostov was not listening.

�We�re not diplomatic officials, we�re soldiers and nothing more,� he went on. �We�re told to die�and we die. If we�re punished, it means we�re guilty; it�s not for us to judge. If it pleases the sovereign emperor to recognize Bonaparte as emperor and conclude an alliance with him�it means it has to be so. And if we start judging and reasoning about everything, then there�ll be nothing sacred left. Next we�ll be saying there�s no God, no anything,� shouted Nikolai, banging the table, quite inappropriately in his interlocutors� opinion, but quite in keeping with his own train of thought.

�Our business is to do our duty, to cut and slash, not to think, that�s all,� he concluded.

�And to drink,� said one of the officers, unwilling to quarrel.

�Yes, and to drink,� Nikolai picked up. �Hey, you! Another bottle!� he shouted.



��������� Part Three ���������


I

In 1808 the emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a new meeting with the emperor Napoleon, and there was much talk in Petersburg high society about the grandeur of this solemn meeting.

In 1809 the closeness of the two rulers of the world, as Napoleon and Alexander were called, had reached the point that, when Napoleon declared war on Austria that year, a Russian corps went abroad to assist their former enemy, Bonaparte, against their former ally, the Austrian emperor, and there was talk in high circles about the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and one of the emperor Alexander�s sisters. But, besides considerations of foreign policy, the attention of Russian society at that time was turned with particular keenness to the internal reforms that were then being carried out in all parts of the government.

Life meanwhile, people�s real life with its essential concerns of health, illness, work, rest, with its concerns of thought, learning, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, passions, went on as always, independently and outside of any political closeness or enmity with Napoleon Bonaparte and outside all possible reforms.

Prince Andrei had been living in the country for two years without a break. All those undertakings which Pierre had initiated on his estates and had not brought to any result, constantly changing from one thing to another�all these undertakings, without talking about them to anyone and without any noticeable effort, had been carried out by Prince Andrei.

He possessed in the highest degree that practical tenacity, lacking in Pierre, which kept things in motion without any big gestures and efforts on his part.

On one of his estates of three hundred souls, the peasants were registered as free plowmen (this was one of the first examples in Russia), on some others the corv&#233;e was replaced by quitrent. A trained midwife was invited to Bogucharovo at his expense to help women in childbirth, and a priest was paid to teach the children of the peasants and servants to read and write.

Prince Andrei spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his son, who was still in the care of nannies; the other half in his Bogucharovo cloister, as his father called his estate. Despite the indifference he had displayed to Pierre towards all external events in the world, he followed them assiduously, received many books, and, to his own astonishment, noticed, when people from Petersburg came to visit him or his father, fresh from the very whirlwind of life, that these people, in their knowledge of all that was happening in external and internal politics, were far behind him, who sat all the time in the country.

Besides being taken up with his estates, besides being generally taken up with reading the most varied books, Prince Andrei was taken up at that time with a critical analysis of our last two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a project for change in our military regulations and statutes.

In the spring of 1809, Prince Andrei went to his son�s Ryazan estates, of which he was the trustee.

Warmed by the spring sun, he sat in his open carriage, looking at the first grass, the first birch leaves, and the first billows of white spring clouds racing across the bright blue sky. He was not thinking about anything, but looked around cheerfully and meaninglessly.

They crossed the ferry on which he had talked with Pierre a year before. They drove past a dirty village, threshing floors, sprouting fields, down a slope with residual snow by a bridge, up a slope of muddy clay, past strips of stubble and bushes greening here and there, and entered a birch woods on both sides of the road. It was almost hot in the woods, the wind was not felt. The birches, all strewn with sticky green leaves, did not stir, and the first green grass and purple flowers were poking through and lifting up last year�s leaves. Small fir trees, scattered here and there among the birches, were an unpleasant reminder of winter with their crude evergreen needles. The horses began to snort as they drove into the woods and sweated more visibly.

The footman Pyotr said something to the coachman; the coachman answered affirmatively. But evidently the coachman�s sympathy was not enough for Pyotr: he turned on the box towards his master.

�Your Excellency, how light it feels!� he said, smiling respectfully.

�What?�

�It feels light, Your Excellency.�

�What�s he talking about?� thought Prince Andrei. �Ah, the spring, probably,� he thought, looking about. �So it is, everything�s green already�so quickly! Birches, and bird cherry, and alders already beginning�But no sign of oaks. Ah, there�s one.�

At the side of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times older than the birches of the woods, it was ten times as thick and twice as tall as any birch. It was an enormous oak, twice the span of a man�s arms in girth, with some limbs broken off long ago, and broken bark covered with old scars. With its huge, gnarled, ungainly, unsymmetrically spread arms and fingers, it stood, old, angry, scornful, and ugly, amidst the smiling birches. It alone did not want to submit to the charm of spring and did not want to see either the springtime or the sun.

�Spring, and love, and happiness!� the oak seemed to say. �And how is it you�re not bored with the same stupid, senseless deception! Always the same, and always a deception! There is no spring, no sun, no happiness. Look, there sit those smothered, dead fir trees, always the same; look at me spreading my broken, flayed fingers wherever they grow�from my back, from my sides. As they�ve grown, so I stand, and I don�t believe in your hopes and deceptions.�

Prince Andrei turned several times to look at this oak as he drove through the woods, as if he expected something from it. There were flowers and grass beneath the oak as well, but it stood among them in the same way, scowling, motionless, ugly, and stubborn.

�Yes, it�s right, a thousand times right, this oak,� thought Prince Andrei. �Let others, the young ones, succumb afresh to this deception, but we know life�our life is over!� A whole new series of thoughts in connection with the oak, hopeless but sadly pleasant, emerged in Prince Andrei�s soul. During this journey it was as if he again thought over his whole life and reached the same old comforting and hopeless conclusion, that there was no need for him to start anything, that he had to live out his life without doing evil, without anxiety, and without wishing for anything.


II

On business to do with the trusteeship of the Ryazan estates, Prince Andrei had to see the provincial marshal of nobility. The marshal was Count Ilya Andreevich Rostov, and in the middle of May Prince Andrei went to see him.

It was now the hot period of spring. The woods were now fully clothed, it was dusty and so hot that, passing by water, one wanted to go for a swim.

Prince Andrei, cheerless and preoccupied by considerations of one thing and another that he had to ask the marshal to do with business, was driving up the garden avenue to the Rostovs� house in Otradnoe. From behind the trees on the right, he heard merry feminine cries and saw a crowd of girls running across the path of his carriage. Ahead of the others, closer, a dark-haired girl came running towards the carriage, very slender, strangely slender, dark-eyed, in a yellow cotton dress, her head tied with a white kerchief, from under which strands of loose hair escaped. The girl was shouting something, but, seeing the stranger, ran back laughing without looking at him.

For some reason, Prince Andrei suddenly felt pained. The day was so beautiful, the sun was so bright, everything around was so cheerful; and this slender and pretty girl did not know and did not want to know of his existence and was content and happy with some separate�probably stupid�but cheerful and happy life of her own. �What is she so glad of? What is she thinking about? Not about military regulations, not about setting up quitrenters in Ryazan. What is she thinking about? And what makes her happy?� Prince Andrei asked himself with involuntary curiosity.

In 1809 Count Ilya Andreich was living in Otradnoe in the same way as before, that is, receiving almost the entire province, with hunts, theatricals, dinners, and musicians. He was glad to see Prince Andrei, as he was to see any new guest, and almost forced him to spend the night.

In the course of a boring day, during which Prince Andrei was entertained by the older hosts and the most respected guests, who filled the old count�s house on the occasion of an approaching name-day party, Bolkonsky glanced several times at Natasha, who was laughing at something and having fun among the other, young half of the company, still asking himself: �What is she thinking about? What is she so glad of?�

In the evening, left alone in a new place, he could not fall asleep for a long time. He read, then put out the candle, but lit it again. The room, with the shutters closed from inside, was hot. He was vexed with this stupid old man (as he called Rostov), who had detained him, assuring him that the necessary papers had not yet been brought from town, and vexed with himself for having stayed.

Prince Andrei got up and went to open the window. As soon as he opened the shutters, moonlight, as if it had been watching at the window a long time waiting for that, burst into the room. He opened the window. The night was fresh and stilly bright. Just under his window was a row of trimmed trees, black on one side and silvery bright on the other. Under the trees was some juicy, wet, curly growth, with touches of silver on its leaves and stems. Further beyond the black trees was some roof glistening with dew, to the right a big, curly tree with a bright white trunk and branches, and above it a nearly full moon against the light, nearly starless spring sky. Prince Andrei leaned his elbows on the windowsill and fixed his eyes on this sky.

Prince Andrei�s room was on the middle floor; there were also people in the rooms above him, and they were not asleep. He heard feminine talk overhead.

�Just one more time, said a feminine voice overhead, which Prince Andrei recognized at once.

�But when are you going to sleep?� another voice replied.

�I don�t want to, I can�t sleep, what am I to do? Well, one last time��

Two feminine voices sang some musical phrase which made up the end of something.

�Ah, how lovely! Well, now let�s sleep, that�s the end.�

�You sleep, I can�t,� the first voice answered, coming close to the window. She evidently leaned all the way out of the window, because he could hear the rustle of her dress and even her breathing. Everything became hushed and stone-still, like the moon and its light and shadows. Prince Andrei was also afraid to stir, lest he betray his involuntary presence.

�Sonya! Sonya!� the first voice was heard again. �How can you sleep! Just look how lovely it is! Ah, how lovely! Wake up, Sonya,� she said almost with tears in her voice. �There�s never, never been such a lovely night.�

Sonya made some grudging reply.

�No, just look, what a moon!�Ah, how lovely! Come here. Darling, dear heart, come here. Well, you see? I�d like to sit on my heels, like this, take myself by the knees�tight, as tight as possible, you�ve got to strain�and fly away! Like this!�

�Enough, you�ll fall.�

Sounds of a struggle were heard, and Sonya�s displeased voice:

�It�s past one o�clock.�

�Oh, you just spoil everything for me. Well, go, go.�

Everything fell silent again, but Prince Andrei knew that she was still sitting up there, he heard an occasional quiet stirring, an occasional sigh.

�Ah, my God! my God! what on earth is it!� she suddenly cried. �If it�s sleep, it�s sleep!� and she slammed the window.

�She doesn�t care at all about my existence!� Prince Andrei thought all the while he was listening to her talk, for some reason expecting and fearing that she would say something about him. �And she again! As if on purpose!� he thought. In his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected tangle of youthful thoughts and hopes, contradictory to his whole life, that, feeling himself unable to comprehend his own state, he fell asleep at once.


III

The next day, having taken leave of the count alone, without waiting for the ladies to come out, Prince Andrei drove home.

It was already the beginning of June when Prince Andrei, on his way home, drove again into that birch woods, where that gnarled old oak had struck him so strangely and memorably. The ringing of the harness bells was still more muffled in the woods than a month ago; everything was filled out, shady, and dense; and the young firs scattered through the woods did not disrupt the overall beauty and, imitating the general character, showed the tender green of their fluffy young shoots.

The whole day had been hot, there was a thunderstorm gathering somewhere, but only a small cloud had sent a sprinkle over the dust of the road and the juicy leaves. The left side of the woods was dark, in the shade; the right side, wet, glossy, sparkled in the sun, barely swayed by the wind. Everything was in flower; nightingales throbbed and trilled, now near, now far.

�Yes, here, in this woods, was that oak that I agreed with,� thought Prince Andrei. �But where is it?� he thought again, looking at the left side of the road, and, not knowing it himself, not recognizing it, he admired the very oak he was looking for. The old oak, quite transformed, spreading out a canopy of juicy, dark greenery, basked, barely swaying, in the rays of the evening sun. Of the gnarled fingers, the scars, the old grief and mistrust�nothing could be seen. Juicy green leaves without branches broke through the stiff, hundred-year-old bark, and it was impossible to believe that this old fellow had produced them. �Yes, it�s the same oak,� thought Prince Andrei, and suddenly a causeless springtime feeling of joy and renewal came over him. All the best moments of his life suddenly recalled themselves to him at the same time. Austerlitz with the lofty sky, and the dead, reproachful face of his wife, and Pierre on the ferry, and a girl excited by the beauty of the night, and that night itself, and the moon�all of it suddenly recalled itself to him.

�No, life isn�t over at the age of thirty-one,� Prince Andrei suddenly decided definitively, immutably. �It�s not enough that I know all that�s in me, everyone else must know it, too: Pierre, and that girl who wanted to fly into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life is not only for myself; so that they don�t live like that girl, independently of my life, but so that it is reflected in everyone, and they all live together with me!�

Having returned from this trip, Prince Andrei decided to go to Petersburg in the fall, and thought up various reasons for this decision. A whole series of reasonable, logical arguments for why it was necessary that he go to Petersburg and even serve, was at his disposal every moment. He did not even understand now how he could ever have doubted the necessity of taking an active part in life, just as a month earlier he had not understood how it could ever occur to him to leave the country. It seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must go for naught and be meaningless, if he did not put it to work and again take an active part in life. He did not even understand how, on the basis of such poor rational arguments, it could have been obvious before that he would humiliate himself if now, after his lessons in life, he should again believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness and love. Now reason suggested something quite different. After his journey, Prince Andrei began to be bored in the country, his former occupations did not interest him, and often, sitting alone in his study, he would get up, go to the mirror, and look at his face for a long time. Then he would turn away and look at the portrait of the late Liza, who, with her hair curled &#224; la grecque, looked at him tenderly and cheerfully from the gilt frame. She no longer said terrible words to her husband as before, she looked at him simply and cheerfully with curiosity. And Prince Andrei, putting his hands behind his back, would pace the room for a long time, now frowning, now smiling, thinking over those irrational thoughts, inexpressible in words, secret as a crime, that were connected with Pierre, with glory, with the girl on the windowsill, with the oak, with feminine beauty and love, which had changed his whole life. In those moments, if anyone came into his room, he was particularly dry, stern, resolute, and, in particular, unpleasantly logical.

�Mon cher,� Princess Marya would say, coming in at such a moment, �Nikolushka musn�t go for a walk today: it�s too cold.�

�If it were warm,� Prince Andrei would answer his sister with particular dryness at such a moment, �he would go only in his shirt, but since it�s cold, you must put warm clothes on him, which is why they were invented�that�s what follows from the fact that it is cold, and not that the child should stay at home when he needs air,� he would say with particular logicality, as if punishing someone for all that secret illogical work that was going on inside him. On these occasions Princess Marya reflected on how such mental work dries men up.


IV

Prince Andrei arrived in Petersburg in August 1809. This was the time when the glory of the young Speransky and the energy of the reforms he carried through were at their apogee. That same August, the sovereign, was overturned while driving in his carriage, injured his leg, and stayed in Peterhof for three weeks, seeing Speransky daily and exclusively. This was the time of the preparation not only of the two famous decrees which so alarmed society, on the abolition of court ranks and on examinations for the ranks of collegiate assessor and state councillor, but also of an entire state constitution, which was supposed to change the existing judicial, administrative, and financial order of management in Russia, from the council of state to the local board. Now came the realization and embodiment of those vague liberal dreams with which Alexander had taken the throne and which he had been striving to realize with the aid of his helpers Czartoryski, Novosiltsev, Kochubey, and Stroganov, whom he himself jokingly referred to as his comit&#233; de salut publique.

Now they had all been replaced by Speransky on the civil side and Arakcheev on the military. Soon after his arrival, Prince Andrei, being a gentleman of the chamber, appeared at court and at a levee. The sovereign met him twice and did not deign to say even one word to him. It had always seemed to Prince Andrei, even before, that he was antipathetic for the sovereign, that the sovereign disliked his face and his whole being. In the dry, distant gaze with which the sovereign looked at him, Prince Andrei found still more confirmation of this supposition than before. The courtiers explained the sovereign�s inattention to him by the fact that his majesty was displeased that Bolkonsky had not served since 1805.

�I know myself how little control we have over our sympathies and antipathies,� thought Prince Andrei, �and therefore there�s no use thinking of presenting my memorandum on military regulations to the sovereign personally, but the matter will speak for itself.� He told an old field marshal, his father�s friend, about his project. The field marshal appointed a time, received him benignly, and promised to report to the sovereign. A few days later, Prince Andrei was told that he had to appear before the minister of war, Count Arakcheev.

At nine o�clock in the morning of the appointed day, Prince Andrei appeared in Count Arakcheev�s anteroom.

Prince Andrei did not know Arakcheev personally and had never seen him, but everything he knew about him inspired little respect in him for this man.

�He is minister of war, the sovereign emperor�s trusted man; his personal qualities are nobody�s business; he was entrusted with considering my memorandum�consequently, he alone can set it in motion,� thought Prince Andrei, waiting among many significant and insignificant persons in Count Arakcheev�s anteroom.

During his service, mostly as an adjutant, Prince Andrei had seen many anterooms of significant persons, and the differing characters of these anterooms were very clear to him. Count Arakcheev�s anteroom had a completely special character. The insignificant persons waiting in line for an audience in Count Arakcheev�s anteroom had feelings of abashedness and submission written on their faces; the persons of higher rank had faces expressing a general feeling of awkwardness, concealed behind an appearance of casualness and mockery of oneself, of one�s position, and of the person they were waiting to meet. Some paced up and down pensively, others whispered and laughed, and Prince Andrei heard the sobriquet �Sila Andreich� and the phrase �Uncle will give you what for,� referring to Arakcheev. One general (a significant person), apparently insulted at having to wait so long, sat crossing and recrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself.

But as soon as the door opened, all the faces instantly expressed only one thing�fear. Prince Andrei asked the officer on duty to announce him once more, but he was looked at with mockery and told that his turn would come in due time. After several persons were led into and out of the minister�s office by the adjutant, the fearsome door received an officer who had struck Prince Andrei with his humiliated and frightened look. The officer�s audience lasted a long time. Suddenly the thunder of an unpleasant voice was heard from behind the door, and the officer emerged, pale, his lips trembling, and, clutching his head, passed through the anteroom. After that, Prince Andrei was led to the door, and the officer on duty said in a whisper: �To the right, by the window.�

Prince Andrei entered a tidy, unostentatious office and saw by the desk a forty-year-old man with a long waist, a long, close-cropped head, and thick wrinkles, with scowling brows over dull, hazel-green eyes and a drooping red nose. Arakcheev turned his head towards him without looking at him.

�What�s your petition?� asked Arakcheev.

�I am not�petitioning for anything, Your Excellency,� Prince Andrei said softly. Arakcheev�s eyes turned towards him.

�Sit down,� said Arakcheev, �Prince Bolkonsky.�

�I am not petitioning for anything, but the sovereign emperor has deigned to pass on to Your Excellency the memorandum I submitted��

�You see, my most gentle sir, I have read your memorandum,� Arakcheev interrupted, speaking only the first words benignly, again without looking him in the face and lapsing more and more into a grumblingly contemptuous tone. �Proposing new military regulations? There are many regulations, and no one to carry out the old ones. Everybody writes regulations these days; it�s easier to write them than to follow them.�

�I have come by the will of the sovereign emperor to learn from Your Excellency what chances you intend to give to the memorandum submitted,� Prince Andrei said courteously.

�I wrote a decision on your memorandum and it was passed on to the committee. I do not approve,� said Arakcheev, getting up and taking a paper from his desk. �Here,� he handed it to Prince Andrei.

Across the paper was scrawled, in pencil, without capitals, without orthography, without punctuation: �unsoundly compiled since copied from french military regulations and unnecessarily deviating from military articles.�

�To what committee has the memorandum been passed on?� asked Prince Andrei.

�To the commission on military regulations, and I have proposed that Your Honor be enrolled as a member. Only without salary.�

Prince Andrei smiled.

�I do not wish any.�

�Member, without salary,� repeated Arakcheev. �My respects. Hey! Call �em in! Who�s next?� he shouted, bowing to Prince Andrei.


V

While waiting to hear about his enrollment as a member of the committee, Prince Andrei renewed old acquaintances, especially with those persons whom he knew were in power and could be useful to him. He now experienced in Petersburg a feeling similar to what he had experienced on the eve of battle, when he had fretted with anxious curiosity and was irresistibly drawn to the higher spheres, where the future was being prepared on which the fates of millions depended. He sensed by the spitefulness of the old men, by the curiosity of the uninitiate, by the reserve of the initiate, by the haste and preoccupation of all, by the countless number of committees and commissions�and he learned of the existence of new ones every day�that now, in the year 1809, here in Petersburg, some enormous civil battle was being prepared, of which the commander in chief was a mysterious person, still unknown to him, whom he imagined to be a genius�Speransky. And both the matter of the reform, which he vaguely knew, and Speransky, who was its chief promoter, began to interest him so passionately that the matter of military regulations was very soon shifted to a secondary place in his consciousness.

Prince Andrei occupied one of the most advantageous positions for being well received in all the highest and most diverse circles of Petersburg society at that time. The party of the reformers cordially welcomed and courted him, first, because he had the reputation of being intelligent and well-read, and second, because by granting freedom to his peasants, he had already earned himself a reputation as a liberal. The party of the disgruntled old men turned to him directly for sympathy, as his father�s son, condemning the reforms. Feminine society, the world, welcomed him cordially because he was an eligible young man, rich and well-born, and almost a new personage, with the aura of the romantic story of his alleged death and his wife�s tragic end. Besides that, the general opinion of him among all who had known him before was that he had changed greatly for the better in those five years, had softened and matured, and there was none of the former affectation, pride, and mockery in him, but there was that serenity which comes with age. People talked about him, were interested in him, and everyone wished to see him.

The day after his visit to Count Arakcheev, Prince Andrei went to a soir&#233;e at Count Kochubey�s. He told the count about his meeting with �Sila Andreich� (as Kochubey called Arakcheev, with that vague mockery of something which Prince Andrei had noticed in the minister of war�s anteroom).

�Mon cher,� said Kochubey, �even in this matter you cannot avoid Mikhail Mikhailovich. C�est le grand faiseur. I�ll tell him. He promised to come this evening��

�What concern does Speransky have with military regulations?� asked Prince Andrei.

Kochubey smiled and shook his head, as if surprised at Bolkonsky�s na&#239;vet&#233;.

�He and I were talking about you the other day,� Kochubey went on, �about your free plowmen��

�Ah, so it�s you, Prince, who freed your muzhiks?� asked an old man of Catherine�s time, glancing scornfully at Bolkonsky.

�It�s a small estate that brought no income,� replied Bolkonsky, so as not to vex the old man for nothing, and trying to soften his act before him.

�Vous craignez d�&#234;tre en retard,� said the old man, looking at Kochubey.

�One thing I don�t understand,� the old man went on. �Who�s going to work the land if they�re freed? Writing laws is easy, but governing is difficult. It�s the same thing I ask you now, Count: who will be the heads of departments if everybody has to take examinations?�

�Those who pass them, I suppose,� Kochubey replied, crossing his legs and looking around.

�Here I�ve got Pryanichnikov serving under me, a nice man, good as gold, but he�s sixty�is he going to take examinations?��

�Yes, that makes it difficult, since education is not very widespread, but�� Count Kochubey did not finish, stood up, and, taking Prince Andrei by the arm, went to meet a tall, balding, fair-haired man of about forty, with a large, open forehead and an elongated face of an unusual, strange whiteness. The entering man was wearing a dark blue tailcoat, a cross on his neck, and a star on the left side of his chest. It was Speransky. Prince Andrei recognized him at once, and something in his soul shook, as happens at important moments of life. Whether it was respect, envy, or expectation�he did not know. Speransky�s entire figure was of a special type, by which he could be recognized at once. In no one of the society in which Prince Andrei lived had he seen this calm and self-assurance of clumsy and obtuse movements, in no one had he seen such a firm and at the same time soft gaze of half-closed and slightly moist eyes, such firmness of a totally meaningless smile, such a thin, smooth, soft voice, and, above all, such a tender whiteness of the face and especially of the hands, somewhat broad, but extraordinarily plump, tender, and white. Such whiteness and tenderness of face Prince Andrei had seen only in soldiers who had spent a long time in the hospital. This was Speransky, secretary of state, counselor to the sovereign, and his companion at Erfurt, where he had seen and spoken with Napoleon more than once.

Speransky did not shift his eyes from one face to another, as one does involuntarily when entering a large company, and he was in no hurry to speak. He spoke softly, with assurance that he would be heard, and looked only at the person with whom he was speaking.

Prince Andrei followed every word and movement of Speransky with special attention. As happens with people, especially those who judge their neighbors severely, Prince Andrei, on meeting a new person, especially one whom, like Speransky, he knew by reputation, always expected to find in him the full perfection of human virtues.

Speransky told Kochubey that he was sorry he could not come earlier, but he had been detained in the palace. He did not say he had been detained by the sovereign. And this affectation of modesty Prince Andrei noticed. When Kochubey named Prince Andrei for him, Speransky slowly transferred his eyes to him with the same smile and silently began to look at him.

�I am very glad to make your acquaintance, I have heard about you, as everyone has,� he said.

Kochubey said a few words about the reception Arakcheev had given Bolkonsky. Speransky�s smile widened.

�The director of the commission on military regulations is a good friend of mine�Mr. Magnitsky,� he said, articulating each syllable and each word, �and if you wish, I could bring you together with him.� (He paused at the period.) �I hope you will find sympathy in him and a desire to further everything sensible.�

A circle formed itself at once around Speransky, and the old man who had spoken of his subordinate Pryanichnikov also turned to Speransky with a question.

Prince Andrei, without entering into the conversation, observed all the movements of Speransky, this man, recently an insignificant seminarian, who now held the destiny of Russia in his hands�those white, plump hands�as Bolkonsky thought. Prince Andrei was struck by the extraordinary, scornful calm with which Speransky answered the old man. He seemed to address his condescending words to him from an immeasurable height. When the old man began talking too loud, Speransky smiled and said he could not judge the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign.

Having talked for some time in the general circle, Speransky got up and, going over to Prince Andrei, called him away to the other end of the room. It was clear that he considered it necessary to concern himself with Bolkonsky.

�I had no time to talk with you, Prince, amidst the animated conversation I was drawn into by that venerable elder,� he said with a mildly scornful smile, as if acknowledging by that smile that he and Prince Andrei understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking. This manner flattered Prince Andrei. �I�ve known you for a long time: first, from your dealing with your peasants, our first example, of which it would be desirable to have more followers; and second, because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who did not consider themselves offended by the new edict on court ranks, which has caused so much talk and discussion.�

�Yes,� said Prince Andrei, �my father didn�t want me to take advantage of that right; I started service in the lower ranks.�

�Your father, a man of the old days, obviously stands higher than our contemporaries who condemn this measure so much, though it merely restores natural justice.�

�I think, however, that there are also grounds for these condemnations,� said Prince Andrei, trying to fight against Speransky�s influence, which he was beginning to feel. He disliked agreeing with him in everything: he wanted to contradict. Prince Andrei, who usually spoke easily and well, had difficulty expressing himself now in talking with Speransky. He was too taken up with observing the person of the famous man.

�Grounds of personal ambition, perhaps,� Speransky quietly put in his word.

�Also partly of the state,� said Prince Andrei.

�How do you mean?�� said Speransky, quietly lowering his eyes.

�I am an admirer of Montesquieu,� said Prince Andrei. �And his thought that �le principe des monarchies est l�honneur� me para&#238;t incontestable. Certains droits et privil&#232;ges de la noblesse me paraissent &#234;tre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment.�

The smile vanished from Speranksy�s white face, and his physiognomy gained much from it. He probably found Prince Andrei�s thought interesting.

�Si vous envisager la question sous ce point de vue,� he began, articulating in French with obvious difficulty and speaking still more slowly than in Russian, but perfectly calmly. He said that honor, l�honneur, could not be supported by privileges detrimental to the course of government service, that honor, l�honneur, was either a negative notion of not committing reprehensible acts, or a well-known source of competition for gaining approval and the rewards expressive of it.

His arguments were concise, simple, and clear.

�An institution supportive of this honor, the source of competition, is an institution like the L&#233;gion d�honneur of the great emperor Napoleon, which is not detrimental, but contributes to the success of the service, and not the privilege of rank or position at court.�

�I don�t argue, but it is impossible to deny that court privileges achieve the same goal,� said Prince Andrei. �Every courtier considers it his duty to uphold his position with dignity.�

�But you did not want to take advantage of it, Prince,� said Speransky, showing by his smile that he wished to stop an argument awkward for his interlocutor by this compliment. �If you will do me the honor of joining me on Wednesday,� he added, �then, once I�ve talked with Magnitsky, I will inform you of something that may interest you, and, besides that, I will have the pleasure of a more detailed conversation with you.� He closed his eyes, bowed, and, &#224; la fran&#231;aise, without saying good-bye, trying not to be noticed, left the room.


VI

During the initial time of his stay in Petersburg, Prince Andrei felt that his whole way of thinking, developed in his solitary life, was completely overshadowed by the petty cares that consumed him in Petersburg.

On coming home in the evening, he would jot down in his notebook four or five necessary visits or rendez-vous at appointed hours. The mechanism of life, the ordering of the day so as to get everywhere on time, took the greater part of the very energy of life. He did not do anything, he did not even think about anything and had no time to think, but only talked, and talked successfully, about what he had had time to think over previously in the country.

He sometimes noticed with displeasure that he had happened to repeat the same thing on the same day in different companies. But he was so busy for whole days that he had no time to think about the fact that he was doing nothing.

As in his first meeting with him at Kochubey�s, Speransky also made a strong impression on Bolkonsky that Wednesday at home, where he received him alone and talked with him at length and trustfully.

Prince Andrei considered such a vast number of people as contemptible and insignificant beings, he wanted so much to find in someone else the living ideal of that perfection for which he strove, that he easily believed that in Speransky he had found that ideal of the fully reasonable and virtuous man. If Speransky had been from the same society as Prince Andrei, of the same upbringing and moral habits, Bolkonsky would soon have found his weak, human, unheroic sides, but as it was, this logical way of thinking, which was strange for him, inspired him with all the more respect because he did not quite understand him. Besides that, Speransky, either because he appreciated Prince Andrei�s ability, or because he found it necessary to acquire him for himself, flaunted his impartial, calm reason before Prince Andrei and flattered Prince Andrei with that subtle flattery, combined with self-assurance, which consists in silently acknowledging one�s interlocutor and oneself as the only people capable of understanding all the stupidity of all the rest, and the intelligence and profundity of one�s own thoughts.

In the course of their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Speransky said more than once: �Among us everything that lies outside the general level of inveterate habit is considered�� or, with a smile: �But we want the wolves well-fed and the sheep safe�� or: �They cannot understand it�� And all that with an expression which said: �We, you and I, understand what they are and who we are.�

This first long conversation with Speransky only strengthened in Prince Andrei the feeling he had had on first seeing him. He saw in him a reasonable, rigorous-minded man of immense intelligence, who through his energy and perseverance had come to power and used it solely for the good of Russia. Speransky, in Prince Andrei�s eyes, was precisely that man�explaining all phenomena of life reasonably, accepting as real only that which is reasonable, and capable of applying the standard of reasonableness to everything�whom he himself wanted so much to be. Everything seemed so simple, so clear in Speransky�s explanations that Prince Andrei involuntarily agreed with him in everything. If he protested and argued, it was only because he purposely wanted to be independent and not to yield entirely to Speransky�s opinions. Everything was right, everything was very well, but one thing disconcerted Prince Andrei: it was Speransky�s cold, mirror-like gaze, which let no one penetrate to his soul, and his tender white hand, at which Prince Andrei stared involuntarily, as one stares at the hands of people who have power. The mirror-like gaze and that tender white hand for some reason irritated Prince Andrei. He was also unpleasantly struck by a too-great contempt for people that he noticed in Speransky, and the diversity of methods of proof he resorted to in confirming his opinions. He employed every possible intellectual tool, except for analogy, and seemed to pass too boldly from one to another. Now he would stand on the practical activist�s ground and denounce dreamers, now on the satirist�s ground and chuckle ironically at his adversaries; now he would become strictly logical, now he would suddenly rise into the spheres of metaphysics. (This last instrument of proof he made use of especially often.) He would transfer the question to metaphysical heights, go on to definitions of space, time, thought, and, deriving his refutations from there, descend again to the ground of the argument.

In general, the main feature that struck Prince Andrei in Speransky�s mind was his unquestionable, unshakeable faith in the power and legitimacy of reason. It was clear that the notion, so usual for Prince Andrei, that it was after all impossible to express everything one thinks, would never have entered Speransky�s head, and it never occurred to him to wonder: �Isn�t everything I think and believe sheer nonsense?� And that special cast of Speransky�s mind attracted Prince Andrei most of all.

During the first period of his acquaintance with Speransky, Prince Andrei had a passionate feeling of admiration for him, resembling what he used to feel for Bonaparte. The circumstance that Speransky was a priest�s son whom stupid people could vulgarly despise, as many did, for being a little cleric and a �preacher�s brat,� made Prince Andrei treat his feeling for Speransky with special care and unconsciously strengthen it within himself.

On that first evening which Bolkonsky spent with him, talking about the legislative commission, Speransky told Prince Andrei ironically that this commission had existed for a hundred and fifty years, had cost millions, and had done nothing, except that Rosenkampf had glued little labels to all the articles of comparative legislation.

�And for that alone the state has paid millions!� he said. �We want to give new judicial powers to the senate, but we have no laws. Which is why it�s a sin, Prince, for people such as you not to serve now.�

Prince Andrei said that for that he needed a legal education, which he did not have.

�But no one has, so what do you want? It�s a circulus viciosus which we must make an effort to break out of.�

A week later Prince Andrei was a member of the commission on military regulations and, something he had never expected, head of a section of the legislative commission. At Speransky�s request, he took the first part of the civil code, then in the process of being developed, and with the help of the Code Napol&#233;on and the Justiniani, worked on putting together the section headed �Personal Rights.�


VII

Some two years before then, in 1808, having returned to Petersburg from his trip to his estates, Pierre involuntarily became the head of the Petersburg Masons. He organized dinners and funerals for the lodges, recruited new members, saw to the uniting of various lodges and the acquiring of authentic charters. He donated his own money for the setting up of temples and made up, as far as he could, for the shortfall in the collection of alms, in which the majority of members were stingy and irregular. Almost alone, on his own means, he supported a poorhouse set up by the order in Petersburg.

His life meanwhile went on in the same way, with the same diversions and licentiousness. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he considered it immoral and humiliating, he could not refrain from the amusements of the bachelor companies he participated in.

In the daze of his activities and diversions, however, Pierre began to feel after a year that the ground of Masonry, on which he stood, was giving way all the more under his feet the more firmly he tried to stand on it. Along with that, he felt that the further the ground he stood on gave way under his feet, the more involuntarily he was bound to it. When he was starting out in Masonry, he experienced the feeling of a man who trustingly sets foot on the smooth surface of a swamp. Placing one foot on it, he sank. To verify fully the firmness of the ground on which he stood, he placed the other foot on it and sank still more, became stuck, and now involuntarily walked knee-deep through the swamp.

Iosif Alexeevich was not in Petersburg. (He had recently withdrawn from the activity of the Petersburg lodges and was living permanently in Moscow.) All the brothers, the members of the lodges, were people whom Pierre knew in life, and it was difficult for him to see in them only brothers in Freemasonry, and not Prince B., not Ivan Vassilievich D., whom he knew in life mainly as weak and insignificant people. Under the Masonic aprons and signs, he saw on them the uniforms and decorations they strove for in life. Often, collecting alms and counting up twenty or thirty roubles, written down as receipts and for the most part left owing, from ten members, half of whom were as rich as he was, Pierre remembered the Masonic vow in which each brother promised to give all his possessions to his neighbor, and doubts arose in his soul which he tried not to dwell on.

He divided all the brothers he knew into four categories. In the first category he included brothers who took no active part either in the affairs of the lodges or in the affairs of the people, but were taken up exclusively with the mysteries of the order�s science, with questions of the triple name of God or of the three basic elements of things�sulfur, mercury, and salt, or with the meaning of the square and all the figures on Solomon�s temple. Pierre respected this category of brother Masons, to which mainly the old brothers and Iosif Alexeevich himself belonged, in Pierre�s opinion, but he did not share their interests. His heart was not inclined to the mystical side of Masonry.

In the second category Pierre included himself and similar brothers, seeking, vacillating, who had not yet found in Masonry a straight and clear path, but hoped to find one.

In the third category he included the brothers (they were the majority) who saw nothing in Masonry except external form and ritual, and who valued the strict observance of this external form, with no concern for its content and meaning. Such were Willarski and even the grand master of the main lodge.

In the fourth category, finally, there were also a great many brothers, especially those who had entered the brotherhood recently. These were people who, from Pierre�s observation, did not believe in anything, did not desire anything, and joined the Masons only to be close to the rich young brothers, powerful through their connections and nobility, of whom there were many in the lodge.

Pierre was beginning to feel dissatisfied with his activity. Masonry, at least the Masonry he knew here, sometimes seemed to him to be based on appearance alone. He never thought of doubting Masonry itself, but he suspected that Russian Masonry had taken the wrong path and deviated from its source. And therefore, at the end of the year, Pierre went abroad to be initiated into the highest mysteries of the order.





In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. From the correspondence of our Masons with those abroad, it was known that Bezukhov had managed while abroad to gain the confidence of many highly placed persons, had penetrated many mysteries, had been raised to a higher degree, and was bringing much back with him for the common good of the Freemasons� cause in Russia. All the Petersburg Masons came to him, fawned on him, and it seemed to them all that he was concealing and preparing something.

A solemn session of the lodge of the second degree was convened, at which Pierre promised to tell what he had to convey to the Petersburg brothers from the highest leaders of the order. The session was full. After the usual rituals, Pierre got up and began his speech.

�Beloved brothers,� he began, blushing and faltering and holding the written text in his hand, �it is not enough to observe our mysteries in the quiet of the lodge�we must act�act. We are somnolent, but we must act.� Pierre took out his notebook and began to read. �In order to spread the pure truth and bring about the triumph of virtue,� he read, �we must purify people of prejudice, spread rules that correspond to the spirit of the time, take upon ourselves the upbringing of the young, unite the most intelligent people with indissoluble bonds, boldly and yet reasonably overcome superstition, unbelief, and stupidity, and form those devoted to us into people bound together by a single goal and having power and strength.

�For the achievement of this goal, we must assure a preponderance of virtue over vice, we must try to make it so that the honest man already attains in this world the eternal reward for his virtues. But we are very much hindered in these great intentions by present-day political institutions. What are we to do in such a state of affairs? Are we to favor revolutions, overthrow everything, drive out force by force?�No, we are very far from that. Every violent reform is blameworthy, because it will not set evil to rights in the least, as long as people remain as they are, and because wisdom has no need of violence.

�The entire project of the order should be based on forming people who are firm, virtuous, and bound together by unity of conviction, a conviction that consists of persecuting vice and stupidity everywhere and with all their might, and of patronizing talent and virtue: drawing worthy people up from the dust and uniting them to our brotherhood. Only then will our order have power�to bind imperceptibly the hands of those who condone disorder and rule them in such a way that they do not notice it. In short, a universal, sovereign form of government should be established, which will be spread over the whole world, without destroying civil bonds, and under which all other governments may continue in their usual way and do all except that which hinders the great goal of our order, that is, the achievement of the triumph of virtue over vice. This was the goal of Christianity itself. It taught people to be wise and kind and to follow, for their own benefit, the example and precepts of the best and wisest men.

�Back then, when all was plunged in darkness, preaching alone was, of course, sufficient: the newness of the truth endowed it with special strength, but now we require much stronger means. It is now necessary that men, governed by their own feelings, find sensual delight in virtue. It is impossible to eradicate the passions; we must only try to point them towards a noble goal, and therefore it is necessary that every man be able to satisfy his passions within the limits of virtue, and that our order provide the means for it.

�As soon as we have a certain number of worthy people in every state, each of them will in turn form two more, and they will all be closely united with each other�then everything will be possible for the order, which has already secretly succeeded in doing much for the good of mankind.�

This speech produced not only a strong impression, but also agitation in the lodge. The majority of the brothers, who saw the dangerous designs of Illuminism in the speech, received it with a coldness that surprised Pierre. The grand master began to object to Pierre. Pierre started developing his thoughts more and more ardently. It was long since they had had such a stormy session. Parties formed: some accused Pierre, condemning him for Illuminism; others supported him. Pierre was struck for the first time at this meeting by the infinite diversity of human minds, which makes it so that no truth presents itself to two people in the same way. Even those members who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own fashion, with limitations and alterations which Pierre could not agree to, since his main need consisted precisely in conveying his thought to others exactly as he understood it himself.

At the end of the session the grand master reprimanded Bezukhov with ill will and irony for his hotheadedness, saying that it was not love of virtue alone, but also a passion for struggle that had guided him in his argument. Pierre did not reply to him and asked curtly whether his suggestion would be accepted or not. He was told that it would not be, and Pierre, without waiting for the usual formalities, left the lodge and went home.
